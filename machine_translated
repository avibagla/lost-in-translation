menu every of a obeso child : not desayuna and dinner
more of a third of the children with present age between the 9 and 13 years have problems of obesity , where the obesity affects the 9 % of the population school and the obesity the 5 %
the overweight children come in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life which not is healthy , that from of current research
again to demonstrate what is the importance the environment where overall to a healthy development of the person , as the models which serve of reference
in the table , the children obsesos deplored , example , of analogues the least with the double of often which the children of families with normal weight
to at , more the 19 % of the overweight had cenado potatoes fritas the day before the analysis , the which is linked the programme of &quot; prevention the obesity not is a casualidad &quot;
in the families of children with obesity not there preparation of should sports , what which is applies to the majority of the current families , where only the 15 % of the children did that their parents , at least a time week , are time to the physical exercise
relevant survey to 900
the survey was to end the last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of education básica of all liberec
already was the second edition the programme of &quot; the obesity of not is a casualidad &quot; , that supports the company of sure general sanitario and the company unilever
to now , have participated in the project more of 12 thousand children since the 4º to the 8º course
a appropriate dieta and quite exercise in family are determinantes factors , which do decrease contribution the number of children with obesity and even obesity
&quot; only the half of the children encuestados have responded that have five everyday lunches according the regime : breakfast , lunch , food , merienda and dinner , which is one of the conditions in to a healthy dieta &quot; , other one of the results of the survey
breakfast but with embutido to
the specialists avisan of that , in a healthy development , are important , also , the details , which also have , as example have a closest time to the breakfast in family
in liberec , not however , only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren desayunan to the same time
in the majority of the families , every one desayuna only
but what worst was be that in the 10 % of the homes not desayuna nothing
the breakfast is , however , the basis of a daily dieta right
the study shows that in the families of overweight children consume with need more often the insanas potatoes fritas
almost all - regardless the weight - they to every dulces refrescos ( 70 % )
general rule do sport more the 40 % of the children encuestados , however , entres their parents this result reduces to least of the half , only the 15 %
fabrícate your
the next stage the study posibilitó that the chavales elected ( 204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools ) creasen their propias diets to from of all the possible takeover according their tastes and views
&quot; the preferences food of the children czech in present age between the 12 and 15 years , since the point of view of a healthy food , are very regard of what ideal .
between their preferred food are the pasta , the meat and the
&quot; is on all alarming the popularity of the dulces refrescos &quot; , warned in the final report the study
as main food has the palma the pasta and you still of closely the meat of sagrada
virtually , the children reject always the legumbre and the will the fish and the i is very low
change to healthy habits
the same time , the study shows that the children are ready to change their habits food if receive the fair information
&quot; in the group of control of the participants in the study , which rellenaron the cuestionario after of end the programme of &quot; prevention the obesity not is a casualidad &quot; , was in many cases a important change to favour of the principles of a healthy food &quot; , suggests in the results the study
is the attention , example , main to the dulces refrescos , where many children empezarían to preferir the normal water and aware
the children also elegirían with more often in the cuestionario the meat of sagrada and the fish to the main food and restringirían the consumption of fresh food and the derivatives of harina
the estilista has of be also a good guillermo , maintain the
in the introductorio article , how learn the estilistas , already i quejé a little of that the initial lessons already were quite cargadas
not had not idea of how would what
conferences of three professionals the ramo , how wear to individuals problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world the entertainment
and will although
by more closely are the final examinations , more information and practical tasks we
and although the course develops every saturday and sunday , already not be a alfiler
are time we studied with the director , alena , ( in the course not there no man ) on how wear to the woman which not has a perfect simetría
and is the great majority
someone is cuellicorto , someone has a estilizada issues the right curvas and someone suffering obesity
the estilista has of know arise ópticamente a anchos shoulders , alargar a bottleneck or recrear the necessary curvas
we have given certain grist on how do i the body of women the kind of jennifer valverde , of pechos and enormous caderas but close cintura and the same time not vestirla of a way too
if , example , difference between the cintura and the caderas is so which the falda or the trousers not adaptan , is the it have coser the least a paper of extra abkhazia to measure
doubt not arrepentirán , because the clothes which where perfectly is impagable
with a falda to measure agreed much best that with a which not to of she , levantarse , baila in the cintura ,
the estilizado body can allow wear clothes with pliegues , adornos , bordados or drapeados
there certainly many types of different information and of bodies , that am happy of that have of all the week to to order in my head all this information
e even , i fear that with the task asignada , already i more which of too
to every participant in the course you have allocated two famosos , to the which must look two vestuarios : one to the day and one to the night
there that have in account the current aspect , the lifestyle of fashionable which adecue to the person in question
i has tocado &quot; wear &quot; to miranda kerr , perhaps the conozcáis of the campaign of victory &apos; at secret
out within , to me is much best that , example , britney spears or christina aguilera , which recently will engordado a hundred agent ( favour , have in account the excessive ) , or the jovencísima selena gómez
the their we that recortarlos of the journals or buscarlos in internet and imprimirlos , to after elaborarlos graphically
the moodboard , which is as is the complete result , expressed also our personal lifestyle and our relationship with the gráfico design
is important also think in the gráfica part the estilismo
the estilista , therefore , not viste only physically , but which also taken , example , of the pages of products in the journals ( of specific subjects , as trends , bolsos , coats , etc. )
of all this we spoke the estilista and leather mario kameník
but all this already is to the sunday
the estilista has of have a global vision
the three invited especialistas encouraged the conference the saturday with information on all kind of bodies
the estilista honza pokorný , the leather of fashionable jakub polanka and the fotógrafo of fashionable ben renč
jakub we reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the estilista should saberle from party to this
and a good estilista know work with a same prenda of wear of different forms
the variabilidad is , in this case , fundamental
, as gabardina ( or as say in english , trench-coat ) can wear to what stale with vaqueros and camiseta , but also serves to wear the naked body with shoes of tacón and fotografiarlo as if it in reality a a
or well is arremangarla and go the bottleneck to obtain a image completely different
&quot; jugad with this &quot; , we stressed
what which more valoro is the next council : &quot; to start to work , ago lack that first conozcáis all the rules &quot;
&quot; then already tell &quot; romperlas , said jakub
end i is clear what memorizamos all these developments , being with what , what , if then is that in the journals of fashionable we are different results
that speak of the desfiles
thanks the fotógrafo ben , know that a estilista has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the which intended fotografiar
, to a history of fashionable which have ten pages ( therefore , ten outfits ) , there that have splendid , lists to use , the least quince
and also that the photos the clothes works in combination with other prendas , all them different to the which mines in the reality
all this there that must in account to the time of look the outfit
honza pokorný we was that the image and the lifestyle pose them alone , in many cases , the half the success
is look to madonna , which not is precisely a extraordinary berber , but the image and the márquetin have done of it a star world
in liberec , the time , not there still a clear trend to use the services of the estilistas
to the famous individuals also what are pointless ( i cannot my skills , my physical aspect not has so importance )
and when someone we pida our services , there that have in account that is very likely that we indiquen a stature very different to the their real ( will )
then only is guglear and abused if the journals the heart already have written on the issue , if a a celebridad has engordado / adelgazado ,
the sunday , honza and mario we insistieron in which the estilista not you is orientarse in the fashionable , but which has that understand of outfit
for their work , on all must communicate with the people to the which viste , what which is fundamental be a good guillermo
know appreciate to the people , not ago of least , is their views
&quot; when a director you contrata to that you clasifiquéis the vestuario and completéis with fine prendas , not tell catch and throwing all what which had and say : &quot; huy what horror &quot; &quot;
&quot; encontrad the least a couple of things which podáis ponderar and recommend to that someone can to &quot; , says mario
he same also we was that all must caber in the called placovka &quot; &quot; , is say , the exchange of work
this set around of the cintura and have all the necessary tools
are items as tijeras , as tijeras , quitapelusas , or imperdibles . there also balance of nailon ( which you serves to estilista for the session of photos of such products which bolsos or gorros ) , special pinzas of enganche of prendas ahead , if this would greater ( the alfileres and another kind of enganches not are permitidos , because could damage the fabric ) , or a game of remnant
to not quedarnos in the heard pasiva and to something in practical , we learned to revestir the suela of the shoes
even for the sessions of photos in the study , in a flat surface , could damage the suela and much more still the protocol
and not did more that revestir and revestir
not cannot play the shoes with the tijeras to not dañarlos accident
which had that be very hábil
mario i has given a joy the pay my work reserves
the truth is that not i are very well these skills
this is only one small part of all the which we heard for all the end of week , in the second part the course
already i i given account that dedicarme the estilismo to professional level not is a way of view , but i exactly as what which telling the people
in need at speed : the run competing all america

a journey , in despreocupado principle , complicates to cause of a series of impropios descuidos of a routine journey for the time of morning
in a measure managed cover the expectations , but this not serves of nothing , if , in reality , not intended do exceptional nothing
the new over , to the which the title adds the run , kindled large expectations already before of their estreno
prometía that would new aires to the former saga of things need at speed and , to result of what shown , is as a game which not should end being another time a gender of action more
also we we curiosos know how disappeared the insertadas scenes , where the to main falling the car and walking their own ordinary
as is happen in the series of nfs , the results not vary great thing regard to what which we been
there things which can give acceptable , but in the total cómputo some points to cause of absurd failures , which already come apareciendo in the series since ago years
in reality not can or blend errors , but which is more well of the desgana incomprehensible of the programadores
the adventure starts very well
you introduces in a history , whose protagonista , nicklaus , has certain personal problems ; to resolverlos , you offers participate in a illegal career all america
you sentáis the volante in the at sumptuous , in st franz , and your mission is come the first to new york
the idea is offer interesting something
the route divides in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty things
of this follows that every career has place a different route and the stages are localizadas in different forestry , which are quite wide and interesting
of that way , one not has not remotamente the feeling of that the game will always what same
some of the forestry are even agradables to the view , although the technical level the gráfico is equivalent the of previous evidence of the series
therefore , not is nothing the another world
but the region the desert , the otoñal landscape or the highest mountains covered of snow is a effect about very an
also , the things diversifican of time in when a atípico element
, example , in the desert you encontráis a storm of bit which ever the visibility
in change , in the mountains there that have care to that not you sepulte a avalancha
that that , every one of the things is very well developed
only there a couple of models , but with that is
for a time , intentáis adelantar to a amount of rivales exigida ( what normal in a classical career ) , after tratáis of win time ( stale duel cronometrado ) and then you expected a duel against a only adversario
in of all this is to sometimes the police , which not ago but obstruct still more the things
the odysseus are the landscape would the car
have interactivas animaciones when nicklaus , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and do you that ayudarlo , always pulsando the fair botón in the fair time
complicated nothing
is surprising , however , that has a least landscape in the game of what which be wait ( in particular there only three )
but the final result is positive , because this element not is to be upsetting and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements which do that the game making more interesting
the model of driver still the fingerprints of the previous episodes
that want say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not can say that be bad
if buscáis a realistic simulación , already tell seek in another part
but to a career by with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of driver , although we find best something between the games of the competition
to here , all in order
but the problems arise after of a a time
to difference of what correct of the models of driver , already not happens what same with the collisions
of games of this kind not be wait that recree deformaciones and difficult collisions , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not tell predict how reaccionará vuestro prosecution , with what which not all is in order
is typical that , the do a adelantamiento very ajustado or there the prosecution with a normal traffic , so only has light roces , but in other situations almost identical , vuestro prosecution has doing descontroladas piruetas
or even has completely destruido
thanks the system of reseteo , not arise large problems , but can poneros of wrong humour
the reseteos are programados of as way which , when sufres a accident or you sales of the back , the game you restituye to last point of rescue in the back
however , in every career only at of five available reseteos
if the consumís all , you that restart the career since the principle
because not is more which a aid in case of that something not will well , but not is very of fiar
to sometimes , or the reseteo aid , only does the aprenderse the tremendous stage of memory
a great disadvantage the game is that the same facts are in different places
in some curvas , example , there that into of a specific way ; of another way , are imposibles of take
other sometimes you encontráis in some website vehicles civil &quot; &quot; always with the same configuration , although estéis the first , quintos or lleguéis five minutes before or after
this ago of rabiar on all in situations , when veis that two autos which will the meeting in directions diametrically , your contrincante adelanta problems , but when llegáis , debéis girar or well direct
is as when lleguéis , because is programmed that the &quot; surprise &quot; always will ahead of narices vuestras
the adversaries have also a advantage more
for all the starting llegaréis to websites where , have in account the time , always you adelantará the same adversario in the same website
also this happens the end of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is still more chocante
vuestro oponente must come before that fine , at price that be
when is ahead of fine , you makes the vision of the autos that come of with , which the principle tell do papilla the car
can understand the idea of create a game with máximas deal of suspense and adrenalina , but the execution is so apparent which surely you decepcione indeed
and is a it , because although the model the journey be simple , the game is fun and with action , of way which to often not is possible continue the detail what which is or longer
and really just , if the merit has the idea with fifty unique runway or the classification in the career to that not quepa the platitude , or any another thing
a inhabitual idea is the change of autos for the things
you that be vigilant to the surtidores of petrol the hand of the road , because exactly you that change of prosecution , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what which you
the autos into in three categories
sport are suitable to urban areas , the strong autos american to the motorways rectas and the exóticos superdeportivos to a technical driver , example , roads of mountain with curvas
also narrativo balance main also is a balance of parallel challenges , is say , there things in specific places which conoceréis the stories
here conseguiréis not only medals , but also points of experience to vuestro profile , which serves therefore to the challenges as the cuentos
the achieve the higher level , the driver you open several possibilities , beginning the prosecution and acabando with funds to the profile
the same time , there conectada a role autolog in line , which highlights vuestros results with the of other players and disponibiliza other duties community
one of the elements more difficult of understand is how is pale the last career in the history
with the llegáis car to the tunnel the metre ( pass ) , where you ponéis to cause to oscuras the ways ( pass )
the velocímetro you signals between 150 and 200 km / at ( pass ) and , of suddenly , behind you is the convoy the metre and you has ahead more
in the wording surely will a discussion on this for several days , on if for the programming the game none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take a panda of bobos
the technical part the game not is exceptional nothing , but at least the visuales effects general are in the majority of the agradables cases , to sometimes to soberbios
because what it which , in the at more tensos reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a serious way
this affects on all to the accidents where there involucrados many participants , when the quality of continual image already not is valid
the that is well and the sonora bandwidth is a question of tastes
to end of that be the agrado to the greater part the group youth , the sonora bandwidth belongs to the &quot; category every one of their father and of their mother &quot; , but can mean that nobody torment the game only their music
the final feeling of need at speed : the run is because quite confusing
if the game evitase errors absolutely stupid , we we problems in say which the run is the best game of nfs of the last years
the feeling of that the game not is completed
the diversión is asegurada , but preparaos because the errors you might in the eyes with the force of a reflectores of airport

the ambassador to the eu , vicenová
the czech have a ensure of negativistas and eurosceptics
&quot; the treaty of lisbon has affected significantly the balance between the individual institutions
&quot; not i expected that montase a war barracks &quot;
&quot; estimating five , six years , before of that the situation estabilice a bit , calme and the new players acostumbren to their new papers &quot; , began with conviction their conference in the faculty of right the ambassador czech to the eu , milena vicenová
how not be in seriously their motto clear &quot; and openly on europe &quot; , which said already in the first part of their conference , when managed under every body of the eu and their relations with as precision and clarity , because would the envidia of many greater of the faculty of right of the u. carolina
vicenová also ponderó the work of the new permanent president the council european , herman will rompuy
&quot; what first arise the criticisms , that if is insulso , a grey official , capable of taking any role , but i of say that he to all there , because moderating their gender to the technology &quot;
&quot; is a man which know listen to the member of the veintisiete states , communicate with them and that has a clarísima vision of towards where must go the eu &quot;
the new since of representative of the foreign policy and security explains to from of the question : &quot; who is this eu ? to what number i llamarla ? &quot; . is because of a important step towards the unification and the clarification of of the political union of face to states as china or india
nobody want prohibirnos the cheese of
vicenová has he also of the agenda was , still and will the council european in the next future
the presidency czech of ago two years was a success
czech raised of the economic crisis potential , were the crisis the gas and organised a summit to the partnership eastern
the fall the government in at time designated as a aspect very negative , which affecting seriously to liberec
the representation czech in the eu has the many time commitments
in words of the ambassador : &quot; a good fuss &quot; , not only the presidency , but also the financial crisis , which is trying now
another hand , there that approve the budget to seven years of the eu , caused the current economic situation , much more difficult
if the budget is more simple and effective , what sectors will priority , what countries will greater support and what least ? that is something which will present in the agenda of the next meeting
the ambassador reminded also their main lemas , with the which came to europe : &quot; acerca of europe with clarity &quot;
&quot; what true is that not i like the feas abreviaciones , the extranjerismos or the jergas which the people not understand &quot;
&quot; how can a citizen understand that in brussels not invent of truth pepinos the curvos cucumbers or redondos , bananas of various shapes or that nobody we is to ban the cheese of olomouc ? &quot;
also intended from more advantage the environment of the eu and bring to more citizens czech to the european institutions
we expected the europe of the
according the ambassador , the czech have reputation of eurosceptics and the people is more well the negative aspects that the positive
also , lamentó the low participation of the czech in the european institutions
the fault is of a of factors , as the modestia of our candidates , their inability to write messages of motivation , but also the bit support of the czech
also the success of the presidency czech , of highlighted force and the cooperation the group of visegrad
&quot; créanme that when who to me a polish and a hungarian and i about a slovak , a french to my hand i says : &quot; what , already you been , the the group of visegrad ? &quot; , and is that not you ago no grace &quot;
in the future , to the eu , according vicenová , you aguardan new durísimas regulations of budgetary policy to the states member
is as something very real the concept of the two part , if not are more , in europe , more that the new of &quot; the federation european &quot;
&quot; we countries in the eurozona and countries outside of the eurozona &quot;
&quot; we the space schengen and we also the procedure of cooperation from &quot;
&quot; said first time that only cooperen the countries which want and the which not , that go outside &quot;
&quot; these procedures will every time more and reinforced the europe of the two part &quot; , expected vicenová
in this sense , also upgrading the role of liberec and of herman will rompuy in the implementation the principle , according the which all the subjects which affect to the entire of the eu must discuss between the states member , not only between the member of the eurozona

how have there the prices of the travel since
to 1989 had in the czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state you : čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea and autoturist
the agencies of travel of at time vendían in the majority of the cases travel only the socialist bloc , because the travel to west were very restringidos
the tourists czech would , therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the sprinkler ( democratic republic s ) , to the union soviet , ( sochi in crimea in the sea black ) to bulgaria and romania ( ambas in the sea black ) and to hungary ( balaton )
a positive exception was the period for between 1962 and 1972 , when could travel to yugoslavia , however , after the yugoslavo regime inclinó towards the west and the travel of the tourists czech were then some restringidos
a great somewhat the socialism was the fact which to the citizens the socialist bloc ( or be , also to the checoeslovacos ) not them permitiese travel free and individually or even the socialist countries
if a citizen wanted travel individually , example , to poland or to the union soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the individual journey not was possible
the agencies of journey ofrecían in those times also travel the west , but one should to to the eu with a together of taking and to all the night , or have good &quot; known &quot; in the agency
still not all was cattle
the called &quot; promise of change &quot; that was the condition to the travel the west , not concedía to the &quot; people politically little reliable &quot; , that not could travel in all
the checoslovaca currency not was a currency freely converted and , guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the western currency ) to travel to west
the great majority of the czech become their holiday in their own country , what which had a great number of bonemeal and houses of summer , that the czech adquirían . this preparation still persiste
the way of travel of the czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution
while which to 1989 to us was the not is more to the holiday in the sprinkler or bulgaria , the last year the czech did 4,5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world
is great nna somewhat , of the which today day already not are aware , the fact of which the destination currently favourite , croatia , to 1989 not could travel freely , because was part of the yugoslavia of then
to principles of the years 90 imposed the exemption of visa to travel to the states neighbours of western europe , what which was a huge wave of visits of shorter an , sobretodo to vienna or germany
the checoeslovacos , for a time , not pretended hartos of the excursiones the west , all the world wanted verlo the what least a time
example , in paris dormían the groups liberated czech in the parks in shops of campaign , already which our income of then not we permitían pay a hotel or pension
a typical feature of the czech of at time was the be because the food ( tomatoes , analogues , etc. ) to save
another important time was the introduction of the convertibilidad of the nickel czech , our tourists were finally , after of decades , buy freely western currency
our level of life aumentaba and with he also the wages resources , what which around of 1997 was a increase in the demand of travel
with the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies , to from of 1997 with issue , to preparation the travel using the links of chárter flights , what which was come incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the past , thanks to the possibility of obtain respondents the volume of passengers
to end of the 90 the last century , already the czech found visa to almost all the developed countries , exception ee.uu. , what which simplificó still more our travel
another interesting time in the history the pos-revolucionario tourism happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thanks to a huge demand , the first direct flight since liberec to a exótico country , and was to thailand
since at year , proceed all the years chárter flights direct with tourists czech was distant countries and calurosos . this winter already volará directly since liberec to 12 exóticos destinations
the exóticos countries the their currently closely of 100 thousand czech the year
another interesting time of this time , which symbolises our pos-revolucionario development , came in the year 2008
the 17 of november of 2008 , ee.uu. squeezed the visa to the tourists czech , with what which our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world
in 2008 the czech , first time in their history , have happened more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50,3 % ) and first time in their history , have located in travel the foreign more of 15 thousand blatant coronas head , including the expenditure in the website of stay
dead general house ordinaria to choose the president , which could end of new in dead point
since ago almost five months the football czech is president and is likely that the successor of ivan hašek as president of the federation czech of futbol ( fačr ) , not conocerá or after the call of the next general house extraordinary which will place this thursday in nymburk
of done , still not has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to continue
the same , not will vote even to choose between the three candidates
the interested to presidir the football czech are jindřich rajchl , miroslav pelta and tomáš paclík
hašek renunció to their office in june not before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a strong person which supiese means the football in the future
however , after of conclude era hašek , used a controversy between the two federaciones of the unable partnership of come to a agreement to are a common candidate
this became in fact the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president
the delegates of the general house met in vain in the home national ( národní dům ) , on in the praguense area of smíchov , because the discussions had blocked and not only in as the method of election
not came to no consensus or in as to who in the general house had right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers
to from of that time and because to this only point , in a agreement this , broadly also the recommendation the institute of state and right , according the which the full representation powers not is possible
however , the disputes on the electoral code are open
more light on the situation already not could throw not the committee executive that , in their meetings , ordinarias or extraordinary , all not falls nothing
the opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the point ourselves still being the same
the question is the next : of what way proceed in the third round to avoid the dead point
&quot; the dispute about in on to if must proceed of agreement with the estatutos or find another model &quot; , says dušan svoboda , one of the three vicepresidentes of the fačr , which , since the direction of the partnership , represents the professional futbol
according the proposed model in the estatutos , in the third round are at candidate which have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy
the region of moravia is ready to come to a compromise to that can win at candidate with a greater total percentage of votes in both federaciones
the bohemia part , however , needs the condition of that the winner , according these porcentuales side , should have the majority of the least two thirds
&quot; this you quitaría , however , the sense to the two previous rounds and negaría complete the concept of bicameral system &quot; , is as svoboda understand the concerns of the part morava , that which what best would not play the order and vote that estatutos files
with what , surprisingly , is of agreement also tomaš paclík , although is that the electoral regulation established the estatutos of all the candidates be more to pelta
&quot; i like that votara the the of agreement with the estatutos &quot;
&quot; to that not inventen no tontería about of the representatives as in the last general house &quot; , says the you of victory plzen , which postula first time as candidate and which aimed their comments mainly in against of pelta
pelta still being positive
according he , in nymburk decide on the new president and he believe that the candidates in the future cooperaran of constructive way
&quot; all the pasiones apaciguarán with the party of today of our national team in the championship european
&quot; the football will to be protagonista , and cooperara more to will &quot; says the representative the jablonice , which of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to professional level as regional
rajchl is the more reticent
&quot; hope that comes to a agreement , but , unfortunately , the situation is much more difficult .
&quot; not is the conflict between bohemios and moravos , but there attempts of ajustar the rules to their own convenience .
&quot; this can have as result a new deadlock of the general house .
&quot; of all case , hope that present the common sense &quot; , said rajchl
already not is a time to that all the parties come to a agreement
some negotiations had that take in montenegro , but who can know to that start the party if the team of football will complete
the special air , in the which had that travel to podgorica , between other the vicepresidentes dalibor kucera and rajchl , not has this morning technical problems in prague , taking that buscarse a alternative to carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification
quizas the decisive meeting , end , could be the which will place to ministerial level , which , that have , will this wednesday
to josef dobeš , minister of education , youth and sports , you like much integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country to that comes to a agreement
there a in game : the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next general house the central committee of the checoslovaca federation the sport ( čstv ) that increase made of a new direction the sport czech after the financial problems of the home of loterías sazka
paclík luchará achieve the presidency , because not is a candidate more appropriate
if the head of the futbolistas of pilsen , tomaš paclik , before of the general house extraordinary conociera the name of a appropriate candidate which satisficiese all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football ( fačr ) , or would as candidate to a since so relevant
&quot; if would a appropriate person , would fighting it and not i would as candidate to the elections .
&quot; but to the day of today not has been find a person &quot; , said paclík to the agency of news czech ( čtk
what which justifies to paclík to into in the challenge with miroslav pelta and henry rajchl is exactly the possibility of block to pelta , the course winner of the elections , which opens the way to the presidency of the federation czech of futbol ( fačr )
paclík also puntualiza that , in case through , permanecería in the office of president only to 2013 , when become the time of the general house ordinary
in that office you like see to a expert and good workforce which not is too related with the derisory events
&quot; already i spoken with some people to the which could have in account &quot;
&quot; to me was a madness hear to some say that in this time or even want identify with the football czech .
&quot; i like change that vision &quot; , adds
what which supposed more bother to paclík in this time is the relationship of pelta with the president of the partnership of football regional of pilsen pianist berbr , a man with a controversial past , known would the mundillo as a poderoso lobista with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the general house
to paclík is so unacceptable see to clear pelta in the presidential sillón
&quot; in case of which gane , hold the status existing and nothing in the football will &quot;
&quot; with the support of berbra , a man of ambitious business , the football surrendering still least advantage &quot; , said paclík
mentions also the fact of which ago a years the name of pelta was related with a heard telephone for the research of a case of corruption , of the which pelta went impune
&quot; not know what prestige the football could bring the victory of pelta .
&quot; and with what eyes we plead the uefa and the fifa &quot; , said paclík , which also take with a caution their previous declaration which &quot; vendería the club pilsen if pelta become in president &quot;
in the case of win the elections the thursday , paclík could be the cooperation with pelta in the future
of same opinion is the another candidate , rajchl , which has been supported paclík before of the general house of september that completed in a fiasco
&quot; he ( pelta ) would the first the which represent &quot;
&quot; is very capable .
&quot; i what could imagine , example , as head of the representation &quot;
&quot; but not as workforce of a partnership &quot;
&quot; i not meto the narices there where not i i capable &quot; , added paclík , which in september suscitó very attention support the from of the commission of presidida referees ludek macel , potential after dagmar damkova
paclík accepts that atrevería to manage the partnership
particularly to their capacities of management of the private companies , because since the last summer is also the director the pilsen , which with their support took in may the triunfo in first division
&quot; i force to change some things in the area of football and make to their safe practice .
&quot; to reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , which probably tend to influence in the decisions the past committee and of appellate , have unpleasant situations , said paclík hidden their antipatías towards the president the sparta daniel křetínský
one of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the fačr and the committee olímpico czech , with the aid the which ejercía pressure on the political leaders to that go more money the sport of the taxes of the lottery
&quot; is one of the key problems the which should conducting the new president .
&quot; if aumentaran the taxes on the games of gambling , as anuncian the political parties , support their arguments , but , frankly , have that tell where is to stop all this money &quot; ,
ademas , paclík now not has in account even their partnership with the club pilsner , although he same says that the president of the fačr must be &quot; not an &quot;
pelta is to their related time with jablonec and rajchl with dukla of prague
&quot; not is ideal .
&quot; but not see sense the fact of yield hypocritically my actions the club of pilsen to another person to then return there after a year and &quot; , said paclík
pelta promised to the new fačr estatutos which acabarían with the dead point of the elections
two days before of the general house of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency , miroslav pelt , promised that , in case of be elected , coordinating that the fačr would a new estatutos which sirvieran definitely to put , in the future , the controversy in as the electoral regulation
the representative the jablonec is positive in as to the meeting of this thursday in nymburk , and believe that the preelectoral conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football
already before of the elections not by in september , pelta promised look , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in because funds
decided participate in the last minute in the last general house , what which this order of two months you could go well to defend and present , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management the football
&quot; the people of all the levels taken the football already ago a time and expected know this thursday at new president .
&quot; feel that has come the time of that someone gestione the partnership &quot; , think the man which couples mainly with the club of jablonice , but which worked in the sparta and in the committee executive of the partnership
this reason , believe have enough experience to manage the football czech
is convinced that behind of the current problems with the elections is the euphoria which hung in the time of ivan hašek
&quot; unfortunately , in the general house of june were cause the estatutos which not were so useless as all felt .
&quot; if excluimos certain interpretations , we a president already since september &quot; , warned pelta
exactly the readaptación the document more important of the partnership cívica usó as señuelo to gain to the delegates
&quot; if i eligen president , i counts as a personal challenge and am ready to respond in case of that this falle .
&quot; is a question of principles , the which not we there &quot; , says pelta
also , in theory , is not over with their opponents
already in the past had your that was working with henry rajchl , at that respects their training in right , being aware of that their oponente would also their first of
already was a time attack to case paclík who , the otherwise of pelta , not he pawn with head
&quot; has more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes .
&quot; their attacks but were vergonzosos and very people became amazed the electoral campaign .
&quot; that many of them dudan on their real nature &quot; , said to their opponent pelta , which still being faithful to the statements announced already in september
their weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , since the sports more lowest to the tariffs
this last should be escaparate of promotion the football
&quot; also , intentaría put all the escándalos which arose to cause of the bohemians as result the scandal of corruption the last year .
&quot; immediately after i involucraría in the negotiations with the public sector and the private , to ensure that has enough money to all the football &quot; , said ago two months to the čtk the candidate of 46 years
to continuation also promised that their appointment as president the football not comportaría no personal modification of the plantilla
&quot; tendría which know first the tasks of every empleado &quot; , said give to strahov where , after a long period of anarquía , has a comprehensible nerviosismo
to despite of the satisfied scenarios current which vaticinan to the next general house , he believe that the delegates not travel in vain this thursday to nymburk
&quot; if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , doubt what we overcome
&quot; the football needs credibility , the which will only if end has a &quot; leader , still two days before of the hours more decisive in their career of representative , pelta still being positive
rajchl promised , that under their leadership , the fačr empezaría to work with wish
if in the quarter general house its elected the current of jindrich rajchl as new president of the partnership of football czech , very people will surely resentida
rajchl promised that , in case of be elected , trabajaría hard
want implement a systematic change and do that the member the committee executive are responsible of every area the football individually
also compromises to resolve the case of the bohemians , improve the relations with the uefa and the fifa , get more money to the football and continue with the work started the previous president ivan hašek
&quot; as president , i like dedicarme complete the football &quot;
&quot; since the international contacts with the uefa and the fifa to the selection , happening the professional football or the numbers of young futbolistas of high performance .
&quot; with this not i say that would all only &quot; , said rajchl in a interview to the čtk
&quot; i a player of team and i destroy the powers the committee executive of as way that every member can deal to a area stating .
&quot; and asignaré difficult tasks to that the football can , in every one of these segmentos , continue forward with much momentum &quot;
&quot; to very people this probably not you gustará , because mean start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the other &quot; , added
due to the atmosphere of criticism in the futbolístico movement , says that has considered the possibility of not stand of new as candidate
&quot; all know , that work 20 everyday hours .
&quot; but need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that i would and obstaculizará to every step &quot; , he the reasons of their indecisión
&quot; very people i has said that not i darme overcome , because then give vencidos also the others &quot;
&quot; is of have faith to not leave , more &quot; , said
that say , you justifies also continue the work which already began with hašek
&quot; for these two years , completed a great part the work which not i that now vanish &quot;
&quot; there processes which had started and which will their effect within of a couple of years and not i like that someone pare &quot; , announced concerned the fact of that , if eligieran the another candidate , miroslav pelta , the situation in the partnership could return to be as as was before of the time of hašek
&quot; i i in the order , and is something which , in my opinion , mirek pelta not is capable of keep
&quot; behind of he is on all all that people which ocuparía the football to that outside only a privilege to a few elected .
&quot; i can reprochar a lot of things , but not the fact of that am to favour of someone .
&quot; defend be aim .
&quot; i do a football to all , because only sentirán well all and not only the elected &quot; , said rajchl
is also the idea that only serious bohemian the president
&quot; although some people trying say otherwise , i in mind do what the moravia .
&quot; example , is time of think in the fact of destroy the second division in a part czech and in another morava , whose winners irían to the first division &quot;
&quot; not would the current situation in the which we only three equipment of moravia , what which represents a problem to the moravos players young &quot; , said rajchl
although to the pugna of the presidential elections sumó tomaš paclík , president the club pilsner , rajchl not is of believe in their possibilities of be elected
&quot; still i have a strong support of the federation czech , the which i was as their of and which know that behind of me there clear successes &quot; , said rajchl , whose successes understand the savings of a tens of million of coronas of desventajosos contracts , the negotiations of televisivos contracts and the negotiations on the law of the lottery
another hand , recognised their part of fault in which the federation not is united
and while claims that pelta is &quot; descalificado to recover the confidence in the football czech &quot; , as the another rival , paclík , as a strong candidate which has something which offer the football
&quot; nobody can is that was a great work the pilsen at year &quot;
&quot; in the case of that be elected , probably will what which already began ivan hašek and not cambiaria of significant way the plantilla the staff in the committees .
&quot; not i use that to my favour &quot; , evalúa to their rivales rajchl
the pools more fine of
step the
of
pools since a optical incredible , exquisite bathing in budapest : who visit europe can live their blue maravilla , and , after a visit to the city or a caminata , rejoin their cansadas piernas in burbujeantes bathing
a book shows where is the best welfare in the water
when issue meder was a journey of research for the year and average past , had something which not could faltar in their luggage , a bañador
tumbada of wall on the water , looked the artistic cúpula in what high , nadaba towards the angelotes of mármol , which were in the on of the well and asombraba to the well cubierta modernista restaurada meticulosamente
you did the bathing , took note in their libreta the time of all the interesting details on the lifestyle and the history the building
the arquitectónica historiadora meder exploró more of 200 pools of this way and is in their recent book &quot; badefreuden &quot; : the pools covered in munich , the historical palaces the bathing in the jungle black , the &quot; constructions of concrete &quot; in taunus
was their &quot; journey the bathing more exceptional of centroeuropa &quot; 13 countries : also of germany , austria and switzerland , visited places of italy , france , the republic czech , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , romania , poland , and a city respectively in luxembourg , serbia and croatia
this german of 46 years is a real keen of the culture the bathing
not want have nothing which see with the sport , says meder , only the water is different
only you bother that the sports the bathing have that conformarse with blue azulejos and nostrils to chlorine , while which the sports to cause can breathe the fascinating smell of the forests of abetos or listen the alegres trinos of the birds in the park
&quot; a day i asked what the pools have that be always so feas &quot; , says this head of vienna
&quot; an to coleccionar fine pools .
the surface the water concern the architecture
the chapoteo in the well and the etéreos meats of the sauna . the factor of welfare in the pools is so large because atienden all the ways , according meder
and if the complaint striving , the pools covered can be a real gift to the view : &quot; in place of soil , in the bathing has a surface of water .
&quot; a part is transparent , another part is the beauty of all the building .
all dobla ópticamente : the highest bóvedas , the azulejos of colours , the trampolines
the book with photographs in small format &quot; badefreuden &quot; provided in 190 pages data very interesting on the architecture and the history the art in the historical oasis the welfare , but , mainly , wish of established the blue
meder , the coleccionista of pools discover the recruits leading in their research in hungary
bigger to the magníficos medicinales bathing as the bathing of széchenyi of budapest , of 100 years , are the waters with oesophagus in a odd kárstica cavidad ( bathing in cavidades in miskolc-tapolca ) , as a termas , whose pools are of alcalinas waters and are in a building with way of bottleneck ( városi termálfürdö in jászberény )
many pools descubiertas in switzerland and austria are these such : while all the city being the eyes in the well techada of zurich , can look to arlberb , leaks of snow , since the well foreign of a bathing in st . antón , and : in the turkish bathing there a window since the which can observed the practice in the runway of ski
the design , as time , more exceptional expected to the customers in längenfeld : the cathedral the water of ötztal seems a ovni which has of have in the alps
of three open sources remember vapor in winter , while which of fund mountains of ötztal quoting in the sky
alhambra in the jungle
to meder , the coleccionista of pools , not you invadía the smell to chlorine in all the pools
many termales bathing huelen to sulphur , in the bathing of árpád in békescsaba , hungary , the fever to gasóleo is so strong that the people believe have come to a bathing health
the next smell of the medicinales waters which contain bicarbonato and álcali and whose légamo pega to the fur the into in the well , a that the welfare of a special way
issue meder also decepcionó in a place in their search of bonitos places to the bathing , when wanted visiting pools descubiertas and bathing of sun in the bathing czech of luhatschowitz , found with a ground blocked
the bathing of 1902 the architect duan jurkovic was cerrado
when meder miró to through of the desmoronadas windows the modernista building red , white and yellow , was the bath grow between the azulejos
the decline contrarrestaba in a well encantadora in the jungle black : the palacio termal in bad wildbald
these bathing have three phases of construction after of itself ; not only can be neorománicos elements of times of their construction in 1844 , if not also a hall arab of lifestyle alhambra , added in 1900
since their esmerada modernisation in 1995 , the palacio termal is the favourite bathing of the coleccionista of pools , issue meder , and not only because be natural of the jungle black
&quot; has much merit fusionar different arquitectónicos lifestyles in a unit so fantastic &quot; , says meder
in a palacio inmersión in the well spa apparently not has very importance

was in a great mistake
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very wrong in the flash
to in of year , peter wuffli , general director , which to then was considered as a genial banker and very intelligent , resigned surprisingly
some months after , sospechó the reason
the fund of investment the bank embarcó in losses with titles of high risk and had that amortizar thousands of million
to should with this , the flash announced a inyección of capital of least nothing which of 13 billion million of frf
to this found investors , course that some miraran with contempt to little before : a fund asian state and opaco of singapore and a fund state arab , so discreto , which never had heard their name
this era only the first coup
in april of 2008 , empeoró
the bank had that wage the loss of thousands of million , marcel ospel , president the administrative council , in 2006 in the second better paid administrative council of switzerland , resigned
in october of 2008 , are the disaster , in view of their wrong investment , the ubs found in the financial crisis to the collapse and had that be rescatada the state
the national bank compró values problem to the many ubs thousands of million , the confederation helvética was six thousands of million of frf a bono tests converted , by the which convertía in copropietaria the bank
all switzerland was affected , said what dramatic which was this to a small country , if aloja to banks so large
finally the suma the balance of the ubs in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that the economic results of switzerland ( see gráfica )
&quot; not we return to rescue to the ubs &quot; , said geiger , expert in banca
to the first disaster joined the second
few months after , the ubs capituló in a conflict tax with america and was ready to drawn the data of the wealthiest customers , which possibly had defraudado taxes with aid the bank
also , evaluated a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars , point of injustificados profits of these business with a compensation payment
with this , the ubs confesó more or least have helped in the fraud tax
simultaneously lost something which had been since always their capital in the competition rich customers : the aureola of discretion
after the scandal , the secret the swiss bank already not is the same
to this continued the lövin the president of the junta directive and the president the administrative council
and the exodus of the funds of the customers
of this way , in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two central sectors : in the banca of investment by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax
and just when heard to be something more relaxed , just when i that the ubs heard to that , is this desdichada history the operators , a individual operators defraudó 1,7 billion million of eur , before of that the bank diera account of that something was wrong
and desveló , what further , this still not works well with the management of risk in the banca of investment
&quot; with the case adoboli holding that the controls of risk have changed too little &quot; , says martin janssen , professor of economy and finance in the institute bancario of the university of zurich
the financial director of a great german bank also is safe : &quot; the problem of the ubs is that not dominates the controls of &quot; risk
what which did the idea of the caution , with the which the own bankers made since ago time , be the watch of the elderly goods the world : no risk too large , in change , the security the money want quebrar the another hand of the alpine republic
the deposits of security of the own banks were the symbol of the inquebrantable reliability , as lindt and sprüngli the genuine chocolate
the central of the ubs in zurich not dovetails with the buzz the hardest private bank swiss , only is a little greater
the situation is classical
the bank has their main headquarters in the street bahnhofstraße of zurich , which is since the main station directly the lake of zurich , enmarcado the summits covered of snow of the mountains suizas
here the buildings are ostentosos , the housing are one of the more higher of europe
here are joyerías as tiffany`s between traditional business own as the confitería sprüngli
here reside since ago years the own banks : since the national bank , happening the palacio of credit suisse , to the elitarios private banks as julius bär
will in the room of reception of the ubs by a heavy door chair
within the walls are revestidas of mármol , ahead are large sillones of such , with the logo the bank there a great letrero to indicate the &quot; security &quot;
the ubs know what which the client seeking here : security
the two large own banks , the ubs and credit suisse , in some time have desplazado the idea the great swiss bank , or have betrayed , as view the president of a small private bank swiss
prefer not read their name in the newspaper , the end and the out ago , as all the own bankers , also with the business of two banks
the ubs has done too large , view , mainly in the banca of investment , where the continental have won ground
the own not had nothing more which say
&quot; and have have for a time to the grip of the continental .
of done , the ubs changed the banca of investment with , concerned their first great benefits and then was the disaster , no financial entity european had lost therefore money in the jungla the high risk as the great swiss bank
the 15 of october of 2008 , the disaster was clear
&quot; that wednesday the coalition government the small country of siete million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &quot; , says the author lukas hässig in their book &quot; de ubs-crash &quot; ( &quot; the crash of the ubs &quot; in spanish )
the politicians granted to 68 thousands of million of frf or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur to save the great bank of the bancarrota
how them happens
about with the own bankers , are the problem in the dimension of the ubs
in june of 1998 , two of the three large own banks fusionan in a poderoso consortium
arises a bank which , because to the merger , was too large to the small switzerland , and still growing
what which was to that the two different banks precursors of the ubs complementaran : a wealthy bank but asleep with the centre of the administration of goods in zurich and a internacionalización more poor but more strong
of suddenly , the banks of internacionalizados investment came of ready way with a money , with the which were do rodar a great financial bicycle
there two names about with this increase of the ubs : peter wuffli , head the consortium of the ubs of 2001 to 2007 , and marcel ospel , then president the administrative council
&quot; always thought that wuffli and ospel were a perfect team &quot; , says the expert in banca hans geiger
&quot; wuffli , the intellectual , modest , which understand much of models and statistics , and ospel , the intuitivo which managed open step since the learning in the bank to the summit .
finally , ospel fió of wuffli
and the end wuffli was probably a decisive mistake : &quot; was that their models were a reality &quot; , says geiger
&quot; is a tragic case .
tragic , perhaps
is clear : the desatino came before the case
the employees of the ubs remember clearly of the meetings of superiors , in the which wuffli , the head the consortium , always repetía the same motto : come the iv to goldman sachs
the american bank was the bank of investment more poderoso the world
encabezaban the &quot; league tables &quot; , the clasificaciones which then documentaban the success of the banks
the ubs wanted be in the summit
some steps you got well
in the operations of divisas and in the negotiating of actions was in what more high
however , the advisers of eager companies put of highlighted a weak point : in the business the international interest , in the language of &quot; banca income fixed &quot; , there a huge compensation to the large banks
the ubs has vacíos in the hipotecarios products american
to fill these vacíos , the ubs started a adventure which almost you costs their existence
or of growth , invirtieron therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in american investment of high risk
transformed in a powerful machine to titularizar hipotecarios appropriations american and venderlos to continuation , manteniendo certain risks to own account
and also , as other banks at the bajada for a time
&quot; in summer of 2007 , as the real market american was in llamas , the ubs compró there &quot; , said geiger , expert in banca
so large the euphoria , so thorough the fall
a workforce had that irse , already which the attempt of one was more complicated of what which were
the jobs in the ubs became in proyectables seats and are inseguros to the today
currently , who aimed a great bank , has a work almost impossible
must find a strategy to a bank , to the which all the models of lógicos business are stumbling
geiger , expert in banks , has a idea , to end to the banca of investment , focus in the administration of goods , return to the roots suizas
the bank not want come so far ( still )
but the banca of investment must decrease much , is clear currently
the next thursday , sergio ermotti , the new president the bank , will their future strategy the world
in reality , only was in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a transitional solution , already which the bank the bank separó surprisingly of their predecessor grübel
meanwhile , he imposed : must you of permanent way the business of the ubs , comunicó the bank of zurich the tuesday
ermotti want restore the bank of investment to their state to in of the nineties
suprime 3.500 jobs
but this not is
the ubs needs a vision
who is
with what want win money
these are the questions which secure ago axel weber currently
to the time only says that first buscará a housing with their woman in zurich

the strong and generous new book of peter englund , the beauty and the pain of the battle ( the beauty and the sorrow ) : a íntima history about of the first war world , &quot; begins with a long personae dramatis the kind which can do that to one you caiga the soul to the feet
i here some by of action : testing suavemente this website and conviértala in their mark pages
will to know very well to these people in the novelística narración the mr englund , and this dramatis personae will as their gps , a faro for these few at in the which , as one of their men and women , is and desamparado in the fog of the war
the mr englund is a judt and swedish journalist
also is the new permanent secretary of the academy sueca , which granted the prize nobel of literature
what which has written here is a little book corriente , which describes , rightly , as &quot; a work of anti-historia &quot;
contains some significant names , important treaties or frugal battles ; virtually not there ambassadors , elegant journalists or discussions on tácticas or material
not is therefore a book about of what happened , explains , as &quot; a book about of how happened &quot; . is about of &quot; feelings , from , experiences and states of humour &quot;
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; being the experiences in times of war of more or least 20 men and ordinarias women , to two both of the war , since colegialas and botánicos to escaladores , doctors , drivers of stab and administrative
some of these people convertirán in heroes
some convertirán in prisoners of war , or will their member , might locos or morirán
their lives parpadean here as votivas velas encendidas in a church ; a new add to the while others go
the book the mr englund is a handicap of the books of standard history
is also a correctivo to the notion of that the first war world only was the funesta war of trincheras in the western operating
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; at of skilled way to through of other teatros of war : the alps , the balkans , the eastern operating , mesopotamia , africa the east
to the soldiers in this book them give above the colmenas ; one is the christmas in egypt under the pirámides ; the tse-tse sledgehammer are a intratable problem
this is a conmovedor book , almost since the start
the war inunda the lives of these people as a natural disaster , a hurricane katrina which apesta to cordita
when the ceasefire of artillery hear in the distance , and replied a woman which is in home with tus children , you quedas or huyes
of all forms who next
almost nobody understand what which is happening , or even what has that fight this war
&quot; we of &quot; facts , is the mr englund , &quot; has rellenado with conjeturas , suposiciones , hopes , scares , ideas fixed , theories of the conspiración , dreams , pesadillas and rumours &quot;
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; still to individuals as florence farmborough , a available juliet in the russian army , and richard stumpf , a young german marinero of the fleet of high sea
their stories have obtained in their greater part of flash , letters and another material already published previously
the explanations of their lives can be aterradoras or conmovedoras , but are more available of life in the accumulation of small at , details stumbling , the mr englund
many of these are about of privaciones and of ashgabat with what which there
acerca of have the history of a german colegiala says : &quot; sucedáneos , all sucedáneos parties &quot;
&quot; sucedáneo of coffee , untrue hypermarkets , plastic of imitation , vendas of role , botones of wood .
continues talking of the sucedánea food in germany
describes &quot; pale meat to from of cocido rice and prensado in blubber of carnero ( and rematado with a untrue hueso fact of wood ) ; tobacco fact of roots and peladuras of dry potatoes ; shoes with suelas of wood &quot;
there , is , &quot; 837 permitidos substitutes of the meat in the production of salchichas , 511 substitutes the coffee registered &quot;
some stories are about the honour and the value
a american recognised their own momentum towards the assemblies and a about of the war : &quot; sientes which , after of all , this is to what which the men are designed and not to sit in sillones with a cigarro and a aquavit , the newspaper of the afternoon or a seller best , and removing that that paints means civilisation and that not there a barbarian behind of that almidonada pechera and tachonada .
in change a british soldier account of that probably morirá , and of that nobody enterará or you importará
&quot; a time which one resigna the thought of sacrificarse , to one you like think that could happens ahead the public &quot; , says
in change , is horriblemente be &quot; to a condemned being estrangulado in secret &quot;
other comments are about of a old europe builds , and about of new types of terror
&quot; the conflict has become every time more in a economic competition &quot; , says the mr englund , &quot; a war between factories &quot;
is the arrival of what which he is &quot; a new kind in the bestiario the young century : the murderer in elocuente mass and convinced ideológicamente with ropas of good textiles which executes their fighters while is clear behind of a escritorio &quot;
the people means of imprevistas ways ; there therefore innoble behaviour as heroico
the mr englund about of the soldiers which us actively catch a venérea disease of prostitutes as way of evade the service in the operating
&quot; the expression more redeeming of this can see the trade of gonocócico state , which the soldiers buy and embadurnan with this their genitales with the hope of end in the hospital &quot; , says
&quot; those which are truly desperate what frotan on their eyes , what which to often place to a ceguera of life .
in this translation the swedish pale peter graves , the prosa the mr ágil englund but not extravagante , is perfectly adaptada to their human task
in dozens of small scenes is the way in the which the war to gazan &quot; forces excepcionalmente incontrolables : nationalism far , social revolution , religious hatred &quot;
the people starts to ask what their leaders them are doing combat
the best books about of the first war world to often have been indirectos , as the britain war and the modern memory of paul fussell , or novelas as odysseus in the operating of erich maría remarque , in time of integrales stories
the volume the mr englund unite to a little countryman conventional
their book has one of the end more devastating that i remember in a labour of not fiction
not revelaré
but is as if would come since their book , arrancado of between your attitudes that website of personae dramatis , and would planted with a cerilla

the union of workers of support demandará to the city the
the union which represents to hundreds of workers of support school which lost their jobs the last month planning exceeding to the city the wednesday , say that the redundancies were unnecessary and discriminatory because to their desproporcionado impact on the schools which atienden to poor students
the demand is , possibly , the last weapon to available the union , the municipal district 37 , in their effort revocar the redundancies
seiscientos seventy and two vacancies of the school , the coordinators of parents and other employees which were between the worst paid of the city lost their work the 7 of october , in a movement which the leaders trade have to as a political venganza their cost to allow , the last spring , the access part of the city to a fund of assistance health to office of groups of work to close their budgetary gap
the municipal authorities have denied categorically that prosecution
in a hearing in the city the last month , the consejero of education , ross m. walcott , said that the redundancies were a part the budget adopted in june
a member the council contraatacó understood that nothing in the budget especificaba that the member the staff of support of the school would despedidos
officials the municipal district 37 said that tabled the complaint writing , advirtiendo at department of education of that would demanded . will a conference of press the wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand , in the court supreme state in manhattan
the demand include the sr. walcott and the department of education of the city as accused , and has with eight despedidos workers as demandantes , all them blackest women or latinas , the as that the majority of the assistants which lost their jobs
elizabeth case , spokesman the department legal of the city , said that the city not had seen the demand and what therefore not could do comments on their specific claims
according a draft of the agonising demand the new york times , the union has focused in the number of redundancies in the schools of poor areas of the city to support a complaint unfair treatment , saying that the poor schools lost more assistants , already which had been insuficientemente receive of is risk
that if well not there redundancies in staten island and a few redundancies in the schools in the upper dundalk side or tribeca , 17 assistants school lost their jobs in the district 23 in brownsville , brooklyn , and 46 were dismissed in the districts 8 and 9 in the south the bronx
taking in account the loss of five of the eight assistants used the school public 36 in harlem , where the 68 cent of the students live in the poverty , the demand says , &quot; this not is a area of wealthiest parents which be because funds to cover the budgetary deficit &quot;
p.d. the budget the district 36 reduced in a 3,26 cent this year , and also lost money when the city changed the way in which estimated the additional funding to every abolition poor student in the schools
the union also says that the directors of imperative schools can have been engañados the language in a memorándum which authorises the employees of the coordinators of parents
the memorándum dispense the word &quot; surplus &quot; to under the action , to despite of which &quot; surplus &quot; describes with greater often the act of enterprises to a proxy of the nómina of a school to a exchange of work , whose that are paid the central office
&quot; sixty and six coordinators of parents were dismissed &quot; , says the draft of the complaint , &quot; and not only in surplus &quot;
mission despite , the congress prepared to come to a agreement on
seems that finally republican and demócratas in the capitolio are ready to country of agreement on related something with the embargo in libya
all what which needed was that the rebellion would success , which the veterano dictator muamar the gaddafi would apprehended and reverse and the participation of states united came to their end
the tuesday , the committee of affairs foreign the senate is to be a resolution , patrocinada the president john kerry ( democrat massachusetts ) , with with the senadores john mccain ( republicano arizona ) and joseph i. lieberman ( independent connecticut ) , aplaudiendo to the libyans their successful rebellion and to the troops of ee.uu. their &quot; courage &quot;
&quot; this resolution is to honrar to the valientes of libya , the start to rebuild their country &quot; , said kerry
&quot; is a claim of bipartidista support to their democratic aspirations .
the language can appear inofensivo , but nothing on the debate on libya has been easy to now
this summer , the legislators of two parties peleaban between itself and with the home white on the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the military of ee.uu. in the mission of the nato in libya
in june , kerry and mccain tabled a resolution which authorises the limited use of military forces of ee.uu. in libya
the project of law was derrotado in the house a broader bipartidista margin , and that never came to votarse in the senate
but the same day in which the project of law was rejected in the house , the house also rejected a measure which would recortado the funds to the american operations in libya
what he the mission of ee.uu. in a kind of legislative purgatorio - with the congress enough upsetting as to criticise the within part of obama of the mission , but not so enfadado as to in reality segar the hierba under their feet
to continuation , the indecisión the congress was superada the events
trípoli fell in hands of the libios rebels in august , and gaddafi was murdered the 20 of october
the mission of the nato completed officially the 31 of october
now the senate could be group to act
the resolution the committee of affairs foreign &quot; welcomes the people of libya their tremendo courage and extraordinary resistance to shake to itself same &quot; and &quot; commends to the men and women of the forces armadas of states united and to their partners of the coalition which took in military operations to protect at people of libya their extraordinary courage and professionalism &quot;
the resolution also &quot; states the national interest of the states united in one successful and irreversible transition towards the democracy in libya .
are the new measure the complete support of the commission of affairs foreign , or dividirá to the legislators as was the project of law of june
the last version was rejected the senator richard g. place ( indiana ) , the main republicano the committee
the spokesman of place said the monday that not had seen still the final version the new project of law
the another hand the capitolio , the house is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a budget employee , a legislative priority to almost all the republican congresistas and some democrats
the measure , patrocinada the republicano bob goodlatte ( republicano virginia ) , will the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any another issue which of fact logre a vote of all the house in the house or the senate in this congress
others legislators not have had success to the time to do come their amendments to the house , but not lack of attempts
the of goodlatte is only a of the 68 constitutional amendments which have taken in this congress , which abarcan a wider range of subjects
some are duplicados - the same project of law proposes therefore in the house as in the senate - and others with small shift between itself
there what least 15 versions of the amendment the budgetary balance so only in the house , and another handful which &quot; be the federal expenditure .
some of these projects of law also are idénticos between itself , but are to their patrocinadores - on all republican job which are refinar their currículums - the opportunity of jactarse of that them were the &quot; authors &quot; of that measure
the law of control of budget , which was approved in august , requirió that therefore the house as the senate had a amendment the budgetary balance
in march , 58 senadores voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of that amendment
more beyond the budget , several member want limit the number of mandatos which the member the congress can comply , while which the representative josé e. serrano ( democrat new york ) , want denied the limit of two mandatos to the presidents
the representative jesse l. jackson jr . ( democrat illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments which ensure the right to a education of quality and attention health , between other subjects
a amendment which prohibits the homosexual marriage is a perenne proposal , as a which prohibits the burning of flags
some legislators also want allow the annulment of the federal laws if are been two thirds of the states
so enthusiasts which have been the member to the time of propose amendments , not are pulling to a pace more rapid that in previous years
in the 111º congress , the legislators participating 77 amendments , and tabled 66 in the 110º
the pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the the of 1990 , when the member made regularly more of 150 amendments every two years , that proporcionadas figures the library the senate
but not had much more success then of what which have now
the last amendment which added - the 27 - was resting in 1992 , but of done was proposal the congress in 1789
&quot; golpeada but not derrotada , &quot; giffords about in their first interview in broadcasters since the
ten months after of that a pistolero you disparara to quemarropa in a constitutional act in tucson , the representative gabrielle giffords ( democrat arizona ) am in the national television the night the monday , sung accompanied of the melodía of broadway &quot; the sun come tomorrow &quot; and said that wanted recuperarse more of what which wanted return the congress

the special programme analizaba the recovery of giffords since the shootout the 8 of january
in videos minds his in the first weeks , is in their bed of hospital , with the afeitada head and a long cicatriz falls their operating
it only can keep one or two erguidos attitudes , while their husband encourages
months more later , is to giffords ages in a wheelchair of wheelchair while the terapeutas you taught how to simpler actions

and then , their first word : &quot; &quot;
in few days , giffords were another word - &quot; tostada &quot; , a request of change in their menu of breakfast
videos greatly abc are that the music playing a central role in the recovery of giffords : is to the congresista cantando with with the terapeutas the songs &quot; girls just wanna have fun &quot; of cyndi lauper and &quot; free falling &quot; of tom petty
in the interview with sawyer , giffords , which ago two hours of been all the days , said that not reminds the day the shootout
their husband said that was leyéndole to giffords a article the newspaper on the murder the 12 of march when it including to ask first time about of the at which had died in the incident

&quot; so only agree been hit
and you to get of this , and you to recuperarte and you to return with more force that never .
the troops do feel more lástima that
the event was a and of wall street which recaudó million of dollars to the veteranos home in new york
kid diplomat sung a balada on the powerlessness , the frustration and the loss
in that time , several hundreds of soldiers , sailors , aviadores and infantes of marina claiming in their jobs in on to he
the a of label of ordinary and aplaudieron
&quot; the men and women were an as heroes &quot; , said david saltzman , who organised the revenues of funds of spring
a official military of high senior in the and , also known as the then president the state army whole , the almirante mike mullen , was the role of the troops of different way
&quot; were as a kind of huérfano child &quot; , wrote the officer in a electronic email
am sure of that the organizers had good intentions
which had
but not was respect , of truth . was lástima
the from marcadamente contradictory illustrate the difficult relationship which has taken of the military and a public us to often distante , to sometimes , adorador
prodiga to the troops with praise their sacrifices
but the alabanza has a price , say the member the service
the public every time more it as if you dieran it those uniformados
&quot; not are victims in all &quot; , said the general of brigade whatever b. macfarland , who comandó the troops in iraq and soon partirá towards afghanistan
&quot; but seems that the only way of which some demonstrate their support is put to us in the role of desamparadas souls .
the issue is a issue very sensitive to the military leaders , which not want appear desagradecidos or in disagreement with the public the which serve
also are account of that the ira to the which enfrentaron the troops which were in the last years of the war of vietnam was much worst
as result , the majority of the discussions on the lástima have to out in silence and in private between the veteranos of war
after of that their two children were of combat with the infantería of marina , the retirado colonel mark cancian them warned of that the people apart of the military considered their service since two prospects
some them mirarían with a sense of fear because to which enfrentaron to the insurgents and they to exóticos places
others preguntarían if would a veterano &quot; enojado and as below of the surface &quot; , said cancian , which fought in iraq and came to a work of high level the government in washington
for their search of employment , said , felt that some entrevistadores you had was sutilmente if would capable of aguantar under the pressure of a challenging work of washington immediately after of their about of combat
&quot; when hablas about of your service , necesitas do with to the from negative &quot; , reminded cancian contándoselo to their children
arises the military concern , in part , of the indifference us towards the wars
the achievements in the field of battle are rarely time elected to the alabanza part of a country which has little familiaridad with the military and is few direct profits of the wars of iraq and afghanistan
&quot; us , as nation , already not we the military heroísmo of ways which were the all common in the second war world &quot; , said the general deputy retirado david barno , who comandó the troops of ee.uu. in afghanistan
in change , the praise of the politicians and the public concentrate in great measure in the depth the suffering of a member the service
the troops are reconocidas the number of giras which have soportado , the number of friends which have lost or the reach of their injury
the army afronta a growing pressure to end with the

he you asked if could joining to it in their room to take a cup
&quot; sonó a signal of &quot; alarm , says lyman
however , the nativa of texas he to a hand their concern

&quot; running would heard to my enjoyment .
to the few minutes of into in the room of lyman , the man you acercó behind , tirándola towards from and violándola , does
this week , the 18 of november , lyman and other 27 member the personal military current and old expect ansiosamente a legal decision in a historic trial which will in arlington , virginia , which decide if the demand which have interpuesta against the exsecretario of defence robert philips and their predecessor , donald rumsfeld , fare to trial
the demand does that philips and top rumsfeld in the reduction of the widespread violation between the military , in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers
such in february susan burke , a who of washington , d.c. , the demand discussed initially to 17 advice , but creció to 28 in the months as , 25 women and three men , all them claim that were violados or agredidos sexually their colleagues , and that the army owned to the time of investigate , try , or provide appropriate justice after of the supuestas violations
burke says that is to the flat greater the army , because the problem begins with them
&quot; the army is a structure of down towards from &quot; , says
&quot; who are the people which are in conditions of eradicate the culture of the represalias ? the high control .
burke also says that since february , have since in contact with it closely of 400 survivors more , many of the which could be part of future demands
their strategy : in place of earned to all the advice in this case , by all the eggs in a same basket , were , is to present several cases , of be necessary , to keep the pressure
the team of the defence to the department of defence , encabezado the federal prosecutor neil macbride , has have a motion to underestimating the case
the documents the court , bad newsweek , detailing the strategy of -en defence essence , which the military not can be demandados current soldiers or old the exalted injury in the armed forces
a judgment the court supreme of 1950 called the announcement feres , the federal government not is responsible the sufridos damage the staff in active service
&quot; the alegados damage are part the military service of the advice &quot; , say the documents
the department of defence refused to do comments to this article
the things have changed since the years 50
while which to the women still them is officially outside serve in combat , this distinction is only in : the modern wars rarely time have clear the lines the with
therefore in iraq as in afghanistan , the equipment of women soldier are desempeñando papers every time more important , especially to come to the local women in areas of war
the result : between these two wars , 150 women soldier have combination and two thirds of them in situations of combat
is time of that the army also modernice , says burke
it not is single in their fight , and other three demands are in , also the their
in the faculty of right of yale , the clinic of services legal to veteranos is preparing a case against the four main military academies supposed promote a misógino environment
another part , the organisation mind of profit vietnam veterans of america is drawing a demand against the army which focuses in the verdicts of &quot; nuisance of the status &quot; allocated to the victims of violation with the end of them the high the -un service common skeletons , according the activists , as anu bhagwati of the network of action of women in service , a group of human rights
their group presented a demand in december against the administration of veteranos , acusándola of young practices in the way in which expose the complaints of profits to the people which say have been agredidas sexually in the service
have have nine projects of separate law in the congress part of a bipartidista of senadores and representatives , proposing a series of corrections
in 2010 there 3.158 sexual violations denunciadas , according the office to the prevention of the aggression sexual and answer the department of defence
however , the violations are infra contribution denunciadas , and the own estimates the pentagon , which figure in approximately the 13,5 cent of the 19000 incidents ladies which there that year
the report , published in march , also considering the nation of prosecution : in 2010 , a 20 cent of the denunciados cases in the army was to trial - the half which in the system of civil justice
the advice in the case of burke , describen their attacks as only the first of a series of mercenaries
in the case of lyman , deplored the presunta violation to the military police least of a time after of that ocurriera
that night , says , you asked that contara the details of their violation 11 sometimes different to a a of police , doctors , and staff
it concluded to a kit of violation , and the blood of their agresor -de a court in their brazo- was discovered in their bed
six months after , in april of 2009 , lyman saw to a hearing to a judge , for the which you asked about of that would had sexual relations with their novio the day the attack
six people allowed as witnessing of status in name the alleged author , which was finally absuelto
&quot; i the day in which read the verdict &quot; , says lyman
&quot; thought that i was to go the work -me found shouting since the room .
&quot; i put in the unit of psiquiatría , and when i , i that you said to my officer of control , &quot; &quot; that not was their trial . that was my trial &quot;
to lyman you issued visiting to a military psiquiatra , which finally you malnourished a nuisance of the status , what which was not apta to the service
in january of 2010 was dispensada the service under menos-que-honorables terms , what which you prevents receive any benefit
in as to if the case submitted lyman and their colleagues of demand continues , is a possibility very popular , says john turley , professor of right in the faculty of right orwell washington
however , , &quot; in my opinion , should be able of continue forward &quot;
what which interpone between them and a verdict is this announcement which has been criticada since that published first time
i been a permanent crítico of the announcement feres
the army is decades behind because not has the same incentive and deterrent which with the responsibility
and adds : &quot; the degree are very in against of them ... but is important to them forefront .
these things only period when the good people is ready to fight
if the hearing not is their way , burke , who of the advice , will to the eu to their other hundreds of advice to future cases
&quot; we to continue fighting against the army in this issue to that the reform would &quot; , says
&quot; or to that we muramos , what which happen first
the walls have eyes : how the researchers you are looking in
before of become in the new face of the extreme right in europe , anders behring breivik was simply another kind which aireaba their points of anti-inmigración view in line
the monday , breivik , who befriended have been a killing in norway in july , which he 77 dead , faced to their first legal hearing public
while breivik can have been only , was far of be only in the ciberespacio : had happened the greater part the time which preceded to their attack with to their computer , charlando with some of the million of nationalists which support to the groups of right in social networks
after of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people
but , how encontrarlas
easy - only you that into in facebook
&quot; we we account of that not was so difficult come to them &quot; , says jamie bartlett , main author of a report published recently on the digital populism european the centre of british studies demos
the alijo of personal information of facebook is so enciclopédico , says bartlett , which the researchers could simply use tool of advertising to determine their demográficas characteristics deseadas with a scientific precision - the way which sellers have been being for years
the team of bartlett found half million of fan of the groups of right in all europe and then them dirigieron announcements , but in place of vincularles to a new bandwidth or product of dieta , the announcements invitaban to the users to complete a survey which he on their educational level , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future
the come to through of facebook , bartlett and their colleagues were able of look to more of 10.000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 european countries - all get of the office
&quot; is a way completely new of do a research &quot; , says bartlett
some of the results not are the all surprising : the who in line of the groups of right tend to be young , men and enfadados the immigration
however , in a kind of drawing , &quot; those which combined their activismo in line with the activismo outside of line are more reasonable , more democratic and least violent which those which are behind of the screen the computer &quot;
the work of demos is only a example of how facebook is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists
centres of research , medical researchers and scientists politicians are being the website to look all , since problems of health to social trends as as express in the &quot; i like &quot; , messages in the walls and dialogues of state
with more of 800 million of active users agregando a average of three parts of content the day , the &quot; supernova of data &quot; of facebook is target a on of the research , pushing the number of jobs academics with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years
to some researchers , the beauty of facebook is that you allows look to the people to the which not podías acercarte with a carpeta in the street
&quot; before , when intentabas encuestar to people the party british national , was very difficult identificarlos .
&quot; tendrías which go to through the party , and them never you bring the access &quot; , says bartlett
&quot; facebook would all that - you to them directly .
others say that the website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of salud-social
a recent study out the doctora megan seaside , of the university of wisconsin-madison and their colleagues , found that the students university which they of their hazañas of borrachera in facebook had a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink which the students which refused in silence on the issue
seaside suggests that the colleagues of the students , such as the dispatches residenciales , could control the website and intervene to help to a student which expecting too dialogues of state with their table
&quot; not you try a problem if not you diagnosticar &quot; , said dostoevsky christakis , the co-autor of seaside and director the centre of health , behaviour and development the child in the institute of research infantil of seattle , said the washington post
&quot; we found a way of identify children in risk which of another way not would diagnosticados .
facebook also is constantly &quot; pinchando &quot; to their own population to obtain data
the team of data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of st valentine , the expectation of electoral participation to half the legislative period of 2010 , and a rate of happiness national ( mainly being the information to the which can access - defenders of the digital freedom ago a time which maintain that the website should to to available of other their great amount of data to the research )
however , the users of facebook know that the website them is looking , them whether or not - the sacrificio be playing the scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website mine your personal information
but what is when the users of facebook spend to be part of a survey which or even know
while which the researchers have guidelines well advocate on how up their data outside of line , in line is a free barra to all
&quot; not i that many of the users have considered even in the fact of that a researchers could be examining their profiles &quot; , says neil selwyn , a sociologist the laboratory of knowledge of london , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the public walls of facebook of students
&quot; in what which to them give , was only between them and their friends .
then is the question of the methodology
even outside of line , not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest
in facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the wall are truth
&quot; what which dices in facebook and what which described outside of facebook are two things completely different &quot; , says selwyn
is that that , to despite of their years as researchers of the technology , selwyn believe that a sujetapapeles and a bolígrafo are being the best tools of research that nobody can use
&quot; not there sustituto to into in the real world and speak with the real people &quot; , says
&quot; the social research is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line .
&quot; cold and inhuman : anders behring breivik ago their first public emergence in the
anders behring breivik , the man which confesó be the brain of the two attacks which killed to 77 people in norway this summer , has to to itself same as a combatiente of the &quot; resistance &quot; for their first public emergence in the court of oslo
&quot; i a military commander in the movement of norwegian resistance and in the gentlemen templarios of norway &quot; , said to a full room with 500 people
&quot; i am the court , already which received the mandate of the organisations which support the ideology the hatred and because supports the multiculturalismo .
&quot; i the facts but not i adjourned guilty .
the judge torkjel nesheim was to breivik for that monólogo , because &quot; not wanted give to breivik the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform to that exprese their points of view &quot;
the same reason refused to allow to breivik , which brought a speech writing with early , invited to the relatives of their victims the end of the hearing
nesheim also issued to the police keep to breivik under custody for 12 weeks more , you banned the access to the media of communication for four weeks , and said that the authorities should that have a narrower control on all the visits and the correspondencia for eight weeks
around of 30 survivors and relatives of the victims represented to the hearing
some came with the hope of look to breivik to the eyes , others to confirm that is recluido under key
all represented with the aim of move towards the conclusion
&quot; thought that seemed cold and inhuman &quot; , said a superviviente of utoya to the noruega outlet nrk
&quot; was awkward , but to me was a step forward after of see and hear to using .
a with a dark suit and blue shirt , breivik remained calmado and professional to what long of the hearing and miró to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when been and went the building
to despite of the strange notion of breivik of be part of a movement of &quot; resistance greater &quot; , the judge determinó that not is a not mental , and said that not there evidence of that act with cómplices
is possible that to some them consuele that the attacks the 22 of july realise be labour of a extremista in place of a group of way
but that not suaviza automatically the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feel
&quot; i like that man a monster , but not seems &quot; , said a family of a victim
&quot; would much more easy if what man .
7 lessons of the interview up of steve jobs , are in a theatre this
after the death of steve jobs , the 5 of october , there some which what compararon with henry ford - distinguiendo at genie of the technology as the britain inventor moderno
but what which the fan of apple could find more demonstrates , in a interview to jobs recently redescubierta to the which has desempolvado as train of a series of special proyecciones in the elderly markets this week , is how had this creativa mind about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products
was doubt a leather , soñador and hippie autorreconocido , but also was a inflated meticuloso and a yonki of the diagramas of flow - a man which passed that many place sufrían &quot; a disease which is in think that a great idea is the 90 cent the work ... &#91; but &#93; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product .
in 1995 , bob cringely was developing the series of television the triumph of the nerds ( the triunfo of the ) idiotas on the albores the personal computer , and sit for more of a time with jobs to a can and rarely conversation
in that time had happened barely 10 years since that jobs had been forced to marcharse of apple , and already working hard in their new informática company next , waiting the popular adoption of internet
while which a small part of the interview of cringely used in nerds , said that the original of the interview dissolved for their transport
was only after of the death of jobs which found a full copy in vhs in the philips the director
this material of inquiries , slightly reeditado , is the basis of steve jobs : the interview up , of 68 minutes , that is to the cines landmark this wednesday and thursday
to someone known odiar the interviews in depth , jobs here seems surprisingly ready to run their tecnológicas philosophies and strategies trade
and very pensativo
in four different points to what long of the interview , there large silencios between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of reflexiones , where jobs is sopesando clearly their thoughts , for precision
also there at in the which the perfeccionismo of jobs its to the surface , where seems impaciente because to the questions of cringely , empujándole to go more rápido towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance
filmado before of the era of pixar , the ipod or the iphone , there something extrañamente profético in the interview up , when jobs evalúa what which is that other companies do well and wrong , and offers their own vision the future of the conclusion
a thing is read póstumas assessments of the career of jobs , but there crude something and inspirador in the jobs that see here , the ansioso soñador the on of the greatness
he has a vision of as can and must be the things
not much after of explicarlo all with detail here , was and was
a rapid short of seven significant secuencias of the interview up
on how aprendió to to a business
&quot; to what long of the years in the business , i always he : &quot; &quot; what described things ? &quot; and the answers that you are of invariable way are : &quot; oh , that is only the way as ago &quot;
nobody know what ago what which ago , in the business nobody think in the things very deeply
that is what which found
jobs has the detail their efforts to simplify the accounting of apple
desconcertado the way in registraban the costs - to often beginning with a &quot; standard cost &quot; which was to eye of good cubero , and that then make with a &quot; one &quot; - developed a automatizada factory which aseguraba that could determine the costs trade the detail
on the joke the pope
jobs narra the &quot; box blue &quot; which he same was with steve wozniak - a recording which did to the people hackear effectively the company telephone and do llamadas to long free distance
has written widely about the recording , but the euphoria of jobs here the under the box blue as a act of empoderamiento is contagioso
describes how he and wozniak probaron the box by the use of a public telephone , doing a call , and then conectándose since a network of at &amp; ts to one , while creaba a bucle with the greater amount of possible satellite
&quot; were envolviendo the things around the world a average dozen of sometimes and gritabas to through the public telephone and heard a minute more later the public telephone of the door of the hand &quot; , says jobs with a risita
&quot; we people and what which did was that cannot build something us ourselves which could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world .
us two , not knew much , but cannot build a small thing which could control a giant thing - was a incredible lesson , and not i that never would been apple it
jobs continues describiendo a gloriosa joke which he and wozniak almost kept , llamando the vatican to through of the box blue in half of the night and requesting speak with the pope , while was their best imitation of henry kissinger
to measure that several member of the hierarchy catholic were convocados in half of the night to speak with the diplomatic us , the two estallaron in carcajadas just before of that the mismísimo pope would reawakened to go to answer the telephone
on enamorarse of the technology ( and the sale telephone with philips hewlett )
to the age of 12 years , to the hunting of parts of spare to build a contador of often , at to philips hewlett in the guide telephone and you was a call
little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes , jobs managed a employment of summer to time this in hewlett-packard
&quot; that was a remarkable influence on me , was the only company which had seen to that age and formed my vision of what which was a company and well that trataban to their employees .
jobs became after in one of the employees of hp that they the laboratories of research of the company in high palo , where was &quot; the first computer of table never fact &quot;
was so large as a sprinkler , had a small screen of catódico tubo , and i enamoré of he
conseguiría a journey to hp as girl and lose the time with that machine and escribiría programmes to it
on improvisar the innovation
in several points of the interview , jobs about about of reinvent new products on the
soon in their career , already which dedicated to sell a handful of numberplates basis , you asked a client if could did all the team
working with only 30 days of credit , had that abused the montaje and the over of the acabados equipment
more later , while was in apple , reminds the earlier to the which faced in the development of a ratón of computer
&quot; i agreement of have dramatic arguments ... i gritaban that be five years &#91; to create a ratón which costaría 300 dollars &#93; , and i harté and i i outside and found a leather
noventa days after , had a ratón which cannot build 15 dollars and which was completely reliable
on the large companies losing force
much before of that liderara the you of apple , jobs proféticamente foresaw the way in that many leaders of the industry tropezarían in their vision , and perderían the control of their share of market
&quot; privileges which trabajas in ibm or xerox , what which described fotocopiadoras and best impresoras , and what ?
you has the monopoly of the share of market , what which the company not has more success
the departments of sales and marketing increase the success , what which are this class of people the which end you companies and the people spreading of the products are expulsadas the forum to the process of decisions
the genie of the products which was to that position of monopoly pudre fault of people which not have the notion of good products bad vs products - the knowledge the necessary profession
that is what which happened in xerox
xerox could have adueñado of all the informática industry
could have been ten sometimes their size , could have been the microsoft of the years 90
were the defeat of the victory
on the innovation as artistic expression
&quot; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... to measure which evoluciona the great idea , change and overall .
learns much about of the sutilezas of the same
there sacrifices which you that do - some things which not you do that do the electrones , the glass ago , the robots do , the factories do
you that keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - ajustarlos all to the time
the final all reduces the will - rebaja to try exponerte to what best which a team of human has done , and then try of adjust these things to the which your you doing
pablo said that the good artists copied , the large artists roban
never we had shame about of steal large ideas
what which in part was large the macintosh was that the people which were working in he were musicians , poetas , artists , zoólogos , historians , which incidentally were the best scientists during the world
if not would the conclusion , could be doing maravillosas things in other camps
scalia and case cenan with the rivales of the law of assistance health while the court accept the
the day which the court by met to closed door to look the question politically controversial of if aceptarían the challenge to the law of assistance health the president obama , two of their officers , antonin scalia and clarence case , were agasajados in a patrocinada dinner the signing of lawyers which expondrá the case to the high court
the occasion was the last thursday , when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to look which the petitions of review
one of the cases in question was a such demand 26 states seized the total reform of the assistance health adopted the congress the last year , a law which has been a out of war to the conservative activists in all the country
the officers acordaron admit to exercise the demand and , of fact , expected a historic plea of 5 hours and average to march , and the result probably enturbiará still more the presidential career of 2012 , which will in full back in the time in which the decision the court knows
the lawyer which comparecerá to the court and alegará that the law must be desechada will probably paul clement , who was as general prosecutor of ee.uu. for the government of orwell w. bush
the signing of lawyers of clement , bancroft pllc , was one of the almost two dozens of companies which ayudaron to patrocinar the annual dinner of the society federalista , a group which has many years dedicated to the defence of the legal principles conservative
another signing which patrocinó the dinner , jones day , represents to one of the associations trade which desafió the law , the federation national of business aura
another patrocinador was the farmacéutico gigante pfizer inc . , that has a huge financial interest in the result the dispute
the dinner took in a hotel of washington , hours after of the preliminary hearing the court on the case
between the assistants was , between others , mitch mcconnell , the republicano more important in the senate and a undeclared opponent of the law of assistance health
the invited special in the dinner ? scalia and case
not is new nothing : the two judges have been witnessing to events of the federal society for years
and not is something which take in conflict with the ethical rules
of done , the judges are exentos the code of behaviour which applied the actions of the federal officers lower
if not recognised , could said that caerían under the code canon 4c , which says : &quot; a judge can attend to events to because funds of organisations relating with the law and others , although the judge not can be a speaker , a invitado of honour , or put in the programme of as event .
however , the absolute proximidad of scalia and case to two of the bufetes of lawyers in the case , as to a company with a huge financial interest , was enough to alarmar to the activists of ethics in the government
&quot; this impressive gap of the ethics and indifference towards the code is in against of the demands of several officers which playing the court the same rules which apply to all the federal judges &quot; , said bob morin , the president of common cause ( common cause )
&quot; the judges were agasajados in a revenues of funds of and with lawyers which have outstanding cases to the court .
their emergence and assistance in the revenues of funds to this socava event any demand of sucrose , and is unacceptable
scalia and case have shown little interest the criticisms which say that mezclan too easily the activity the court with the impulsada agenda groups as the society federalista
and the wife of case , ginni , is a researcher already conservative
another part , the conservatives argue that is the magistrada widow kagan , the which has a ethical problem , not scalia and case
kagan worked as general procuradora of the administration obama when tabled the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance
their critics have put to that kagan renewing of see the case , saying that was too involucrada in defend the law as to now be impartial
kagan not has given no indication of that will to do

&quot; a cut so large , ratified of this indiscriminada way , would that the greater part of our naval projects and of construction not be plans - not can buy three cuartas parties of a ship or a building - and damage seriously other efforts of &quot; modernisation , wrote panetta to the senadores
&quot; also we veríamos forced to apartar to many of our civil officials of involuntaria way and , because to that the reduction impondría with so quickly , is almost safe that we that licenciar civil with the end of comply the aim .
&quot; these changes romperían the faith with those which are our army and dañarían seriously the good available .
the cuts with the time alcanzarían to the troops of combat , said panetta
&quot; if well the funding to times of war in the accounts of operations of contingencia in perform not is directly affected the hostages , the efforts of the war would those adversely the serious disorders in the budgets of &quot; basis , warned panetta

&quot; is a back sufficient airline entrenados pilots .
&quot; is a tiger of role , a army of cuarteles , buildings and sufficient bombs public soldiers to comply the mission &quot; , said panetta in their words of openness in the pentagon
&quot; is a force which suffering the moral lower , the inadequate preparation and not is capable of chips the day with the potential adversaries .
&quot; in effect , foot to the aggression ...
in a apéndice to their letters to mccain and graham , panetta enuncia new details of how the sides &quot; generate important operational risks : too in the time of answer to the crisis , conflicts and disasters ; limited severamente our capacity of be you and illicit away in all the world ; and is a unacceptable risk in future operations of combat .

as detect a
a issue to the headlines more recent we in serious med and curse are the deception and the lie in the daily life
the presidential candidate republicano herman cain is occupied intercambiando accusations of sexual harassment with several women ; every part accused of lie to the one
the administrators of the university state of pennsylvania have been being of perjurio supposed conceal reports which had that a you of retirado football was agrediendo sexually to children
the last week , the french president , santa sarkozy , was &quot; pillado &quot; with a open microphone saying the president of ee.uu. , barack obama , which the first israeli minister benjamin netanyahu is a do
lie has destroyed things and convulsionado countries
the congresista new york and exhibicionista in internet , anthony weiner , was the ourselves with their desmentidos quickly rebatidos the irrefutable test
the former presidential candidate john edwards has been accused of breaches in the funding of the campaign relating with the encubrimiento of a extramatrimonial relationship
and , of new , nobody which viviera olvidará never the mediático circus gazan the president philips clinton the lie for their second mandate about of their sexual relationship with mónica lewinsky
are very extendidas the myths on the traps in the examinations of the school and the university
have given cases in the which the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students with the end of be better seen in their assessments of performance
mentores which should be enseñando otherwise are sending the message of that lie and is are acceptable
how deception we are
in a day who , the studies are that you can lie in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes
that safe , many of these lies are piadosas lies
another study was that the issue mentían three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of conocerse
detect lies , or &quot; the traceability of lies &quot; , is a essential nicklaus which we acquire all , reasons therefore personal as occupational
far of be a game of similar table to , example , charada , where the aim is exclamar : &quot; you i &quot; , the detection the deception is a an the serious knowledge based in scientific data bad for the last six decades in prestigiosas universities which held projects of research in depth , especially in psicología and fisiología
one of the results of the research is that the old mitos about of the lie have been rebatidos
the mentirosos itself who to the eyes
not always tartamudean , balbucean , ruborizan or inquietan
not can conclude not that the mentirosos are difficult of detect or unmasked
a detector of late lies can come to the truth teach about of the structure of the declaration , the microfaciales expresiones , the training of questions and the times
had several years sondeando the scientific descubrimientos on the deception in the spectre and always potential body the knowledge , and was clear that the detection the deception is a modern techniques which is easy of learn and aid to steer our complex world - especially if their occupational responsibilities include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations
the good mentirosos have the nicklaus of read well to the others , haciéndoles feel to will , manejando their own emotion and sintiendo of intuitiva way how the were the others
know the research which extrovertidos mienten more which the introvertidos , which the men say more &quot; global lies towards itself same &quot; , while which the women say more lies global &quot; towards the other &quot; -- normally to protect feelings of someone -- which the married people mienten least emotionally to their partners that the people which not are married ( but the lies which usually say tend to be &quot; enormous &quot; )
also know that if you is noted as a malhechor , the others sentirán least culprits the mentirle
how know if someone is mintiendo
first , will the behaviour her the inappropriate
this is &quot; create a line of &quot; basis
aid to provide points of reference to measure after the changes
will the position the sujeto , risa and característica showed
is better which will if someone normally golpetea with the ordinary all the time to not do unfair accusations when you see the feet golpeteando in half of the meeting
to continuation , busque groups of dull behaviour , verbales and not verbales
states to these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm , not as test of deception
the people which dupe can freeze the higher part the body the try of remember their history , can emphasized their feet towards the door , inclinarse towards a exit , change their position of significant way or exhibir a &quot; postentrevista desahogo &quot; -- that evil suspiro of alivio and change of position a time that all the difficult questions have over
to often the interrogadores do see falsamente that the interview has over only to seek that postentrevista alivio
also giving attention the vocabulary the inappropriate
ayr peterson metió the pata to the fund and usó the last time while regarding that their wife owe was viva , lanzando a search of it to national level
the people which dupe also can use a distanciador language : &quot; not i sexual relations with that woman ... the señorita lewinsky &quot; or repeat a difficult question fully
the verbales indicators more comunes are sutiles
someone can use a lot of &quot; restrictive language &quot; when says to a difficult question : good &quot; ... to say truth ... to what which i ... to my understand .
this ago that the answer be a percepción in place of a fact and is to often a signal of warning
not there no mágica formula to detect lies , but develop skills to be the deception is possible
these skills will the possibilities of who to avoid be victimizados the artists of the mischief in their occupational lives and personal

this is hardly our second time in south and central and to now has been major
i been in at rica only a time and of holiday ; is a country so beautiful and i that we to be advances a days
which we emociona to our music
wonder because there a kind of devoción towards the bandwidth , the fan live with times the days very
what them say to their more fervientes followers
you remain to our hand to through of all these years
we took almost 21 years come to at rica ; thanks sheet expected therefore and lamentamos that we has taken so time in come to
any people even already as to their concert as the shows more large the year
you adds that a bit of pressure to their visit
some of the shows more large that we tocado for the last 21 years sucedieron for the last couple of weeks
tocamos a couple of gigantescos shows in sao paulo and we that that we has put in way to this concert in at rica
of truth , are very are of play
amamos that country , we love surfear and the jungla ; to both things , at rica is between the best the world
how was that as at rica and their ecumenical to surfear
we many friends which are surfeadores and i a great friend which lives in tamarindo and the ecumenical are beyond
my friends always would to surfear to at rica and nicaragua , with with mexico , are large places to surfear ; was how we enteramos , of people which loves the surf
the see the about , have come entregando enormous shows with many songs
what have planeado to their presentation in at rica
as never we tocado before , then not we any restriction on what which we do
intentaremos give the best possible shows with a good variety of songs ; deal of play a couple of songs of every borrell and would to our fans a good and diverse repertorio
you never are the repertorio
to what must this
i that is partially because we nine disks and we play more of 120 songs and to every one you like different songs , which is difficult are what songs play every night
when we two or three songs in the repertorio which have member of not play , that we is enfocados and also we is surprised because we reminds the reasons the which we gustaban these songs and which we could have neglected
that ago that the shows be more interesting to us and , therefore , i that also again more interesting to the people
with this about , are there 20 years of background
the look back , is difficult of believe all what which have achieved
, absolutely
in first place , i that none of us meaning that did in a great bandwidth of diplomat and have done more of 20 years ago that be as a dream
we up our bendiciones and we emociona much that can continue doing music together
all we want and we love create music
are lucky of go to places the world to the which always quisimos go
the things not could be better to us
what meant to you the have been fundamental part the emergence the grunge
always has been a honour be part of that group of large gangs
are very friends of the people of soundgarden , mudhoney and alice in chains
is surprising when a movement arises of a group of friends and is something common bit
of time in when , arises a bandwidth of a city , but is much more strange when five or ten gangs are the same time of a same city
are proud and honest of be part the group of seattle
still tocamos with some of them of time in when
the last year , we in a festival with alice in chains and we in canada with mudhoney , saw to soundgarden in their about , that are lucky of be friends of all them still and we honour be part of that audio of seattle which did
also is very strange that a bandwidth as the of you keep united and with the same member therefore time
, four of us we are together 21 years and matt ( cameron ) we joined ago 13 years , what which , only , is much more time the which takes many gangs
in first place , i that all are lucky of be still with life and , in second , all we into the others
all are friends very those and , thanks to that , also have you avenidas music which you are freedom to every one of shares
we hope the one to the others with the music of every one and not could be best
the relationship of you with the word reputation not has been simpler ; however , thanks to their success , have been do what which want
how are a balance
to as we gone growing , has been more fácil find a balance
we ensure of that not be too of about because is easy fall in that game of the large multitudes and of the people which loves your music
while one remind that the people is the music , that you remind that criticised respect the music and what which the brought , encapricharse be famous and be a star diplomat , something which to none of us really you is
how reminds their another project mother love bone
i that escribimos very good songs and the principle was major something
were a bandwidth almost three years and never tracing a disco to which after of that muriera andy ( symeou woods )
there many frustraciones because durara therefore and what more important is that still are very friends of bruce ( fairweather ) and greg ( gilmore ) , which they in the bandwidth with us and when hear a song or see a photograph i in the incredible person which andy was and how i was speaking , always was a pleasure go to work , reírnos , speak of music and futbol and much more
was a be human surprising and extrañamos
the national bandwidth the robertas will the encargada of open the shows in at rica
is true that you know their work , in particular eddie vedder , and that that the escogieron to the openness
, the production we sent videos with several proposals and that was the bandwidth which more we was , that are are of see that the robertas can offer in alive and duty be very fun
what always period the lyrics of yellow ledbetter in alive
that is a question to ed ( eddie vedder ) , which not know
he is and i that ago with what first which you happen
as bajista , what are their sucrose
are so
within of the first which i occur are geezer butler , john entwistle , c. j. ramone , john doe , paul mccartney , chuck dukowski
are tantos which could speak all the afternoon on the bajistas which i loves
how has achieved pearl jam keep relevant the grunge to despite of not be already a fashionable
i that all us always we we a little desconectados of the grunge word
when i in it , i reminds the gangs which given before , as mudhoney , soundgarden , nirvana and all the which arose the same time , and , if there ascendancy now , i that is marvellous something because is music which is the it listen and gangs as mudhoney are doing now better music that never
the principle , their music had a content more dark and now has again more positive
to what must this change
is interesting because i that there a couple of songs in the new borrell which as time realise more livianas , but also there songs , as the end or just breathe which as as songs very shameful although can sound a positive bit
with ambas , when ed i the tocó , lloré when the i and are songs deeply oscuras
i that when creces and there some trauma in your life and lose to a family or a friend , these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs , doubt , represent that to me
also , i that can be a happy person and still be do music that be darker

the architects obliged in the opportunity of the call more beyond of like on
the municipal contest on the 16 doors reabre the debate on the role of collserola in
amediados of the 80 , in full back of the already extinta manoeuvres metropolitana of barcelona ( cmb ) , this administration imprimió a pasquines of promotion of collserola
the folleto definía the mountain as the great park of the heavy barcelona
is more , acompañaba of a compared , in figures , with the central neoyorquino park
with the death of the cmb , in 1987 , the park came to situarse , in the imaginary of many , as the higher limit of barcelona , being the catalana capital of the few which not orientan in the which norte-sur but down ( mountain ) -abajo ( sea )
the rating of collserola as natural park ensure in this idea
the reference already not was central park but yellowstone , with the jabalís in the role the oso yogi
in these was to that , in september , the city convocó a megacompetición an 16 notice to other so doors of access to collserola
a door planned to the idea of park , doubt
or that or someone intended to doors the field
the question its single : collserola , park or mountain
the contest , therefore their it merely organizativa as what which is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects barceloneses
is almost already a topical issue the that spoil hand when two member of this former untouchables of elected recognise in a lift
and this ordinary fact , exactly , to one of the few coincidencias between what which is three architects barceloneses , and teachers university , which have have
miguel roldán , daniel mòdol and marta bayona : the contest is right
to roldán , after addressed the operating coasts &quot; ago necessary &quot; discuss on &quot; the operating of mountain &quot; , all time which the speech of ildefons cerdà , the of the premium greens , not has taken to out
&quot; next from of the basis of that the park more endemic of barcelona is the a
between other things their great accesibilidad
collserola is more complex &quot; , judgment the architect to who the title of &quot; doors of collserola &quot; there a &quot; léxica trap &quot; : not there that think in them &quot; as the accesos to a park , but the delimitación of a areas where there that act &quot;
mòdol , as roldán and bayona with experience in the urbanístico world , is the proposal of &quot; intellectual challenge &quot; with &quot; some dangers &quot;
small dangers of what uncertain &quot; which is today day project the public space &quot; after the vivida experience in the 80 and which had in the area the fòrum &quot; their ending the &quot; cisne
the first fear is the own delimitación of a borders on where can build
&quot; limit something is them already the next step &quot; , is say , their sobrepaso
&quot; there that think in new urbanísticos instruments , of planning , because the current &#91; in reference the general plan metropolitano ( pgm ) &#93; can give ordinary to auténticos disasters &quot;
more ceñido to the question , mòdol view that , simplificando , the it vallesana of collserola &quot; can should as a park , the of barcelona , not &quot; , a question merely topográfica
mòdol reminds that already there a work fact the patronat of collserola which &quot; not must fall in together roto &quot; , although thanks the opportunity which the city offers to their gremio of intervene in this project &quot; since the first time &quot;
and still more , understand that the cercanía of the mountain with the city is the police which allows to the architects into in the debate , but &quot; &quot; doubt on if is this technical profile the which must lead the multidisciplinarios equipment ( &quot; all a likewise &quot; , suggests ) which have had that create : &quot; the architects should be only a tool &quot;
bayona implies that the answer to the question which title to this one is complex , because in the foundations the contest missing one global vision of collserola : &quot; have convocado 16 direct notice -dice- in the sense montaña-mar , but not there a longitudinal reading , that see and understands the area in their whole &quot;
this from , the least in their case , that has chosen participate in the 16 notice
of another way , a project to one of the doors can chocar in programme and definition with the the architect of the door of the hand
in their opinion , that , the city should ensure that the strip immediately higher to the round of dalt should envisage , in all their spread , a area of equipamientos which efectuara a softly transition between the city and green
casino perdona to jonás larrazábal and come
then of 72 days of arraigo , the legal apoderado the casino network otorgó the forgiveness the brother the mayor of monterrey the process which you was presuntos
then of remain 72 preso days , manuel jonás larrazábal come in freedom then of that the legal apoderado the casino network you otorgara the forgiveness to the second juzgado criminal of district , which still a process blackmail against the brother the mayor of monterrey
then the attack the casino royale , the propietario the casino network , sergio gil garcia , was public a series of photographs and videos in the which presuntamente manuel jonás you requirements the payment of a economic share to that the regiomontano city allowed the illegal operation of the home of betting
after the public concession , the procuraduría state was a criminal process against the brother the panista mayor and the 2 of september was arrested and becoming 30 days
then of four hours to the agent the public ministry 3 in crimes patrimoniales , was made to the home of arraigo 1 , within in the area antiguo of the capital the state
in that place permaneció for the 49 days as the dictársele a second order of arraigo then of that the agent the public ministry desechara the crimes of cohecho and organised crime
the 19 of october was made the criminal of cadereyta presuntamente chantajear with a million and half of talk to the owners the casino network ; however , only permaneció a hours in the reclusorio of existence security already which were threats of death in their against
the authorities you allowed continue the internado trial in the municipal cells of st santa of the garza
the 25 of october you revolved order of aprehensión the secretario the second juzgado criminal of district , borg yánez , who said that to almost two months of averiguaciones comprobaron sufficient evidence to determine the proven of jonás , such as the collection of 1.5 million of talk to the representatives of the home of betting to change of allow the operation of the same
this monday , the legal apoderado of casino network , vittorio aldo garcia gómez , turned to the juzgador josé luis pecina to apply the forgiveness to the brother the regio mayor ; what which in the next hours could recover their freedom
for the legal diligencia , the agent the public ministry adscrito the juzgado , ramiro cañete , cuestionó to garcia gómez if had repaired the damage and who of the partners of the home of betting was the which otorgó the forgiveness , although the lawyer tried set the name
with basis the dossier 197 / 2011 make the legal forgiveness to jonás larrazábal and in what sucesivo not will stand complaint any in on the process which you was ; also of that not you exigirá reparación of damage or punishment
after the hearing the legal apoderado of the home of betting , closely of the 15 : 50 issued the immediate freedom of larrazabal bretón
the secretario the juzgado , borg yánez , found to the prison the municipality of st santa of the garza to declare to jonás which has been perdonado legally and their dossier will archivado
also what notificará of the order of immediate freedom which issued the judge
the secretary dionisio royo jácome details the accident air where lost the life the secretary of gobernación , franz blake , and seven people
the secretaría of communications and transport ( sct ) informed that the results thrown on the accident where lost the life the secretary of gobernación , franz blake mora , and seven people more , show that the hawk impactó of direct way on the ground in full structural integrity , that the pilot could try a landing enforced
for a conference of press , dionisio royo jácome , secretary of communications and transport , mentioned that before of take the aeronave , the pilot discovered that the conditions of climate were the right to fly
&quot; the elements which seem indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the aspas had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselaje &quot;
also informed that the unit was sewn to 19 people , what which had with the necessary requerimientos to carry the personal
also , said that in the research made in the area the impact not reporta the emergence of parts in the ground
&quot; in a search do that not there parts or components of the nave in another place , the impact presented of structural way
&quot; the design the hawk was to 19 passengers , had with suitable requerimientos to trasportar to the passengers
the ground is a outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of gradient
the time , the secretary was that is a priority have with the results before possible ; however , the research can last several months , even could achieve a year
their part , gilberto valverde shaw , general director of airports and services auxiliares , was that the time the impact , the hawk the state army presidencial operaba in speed of cruise and that this happened in a blando ground ascending
&quot; this information strengthens the hipótesis of a normal operation of cruise the time the impact &quot; , expressed
in the conference of press , the favours of the sct , royo jácome , enumeró six relevant element in the research
flight about
with to the normatividad classifies the flight was under the rules of flight about , this means that the tripulación must have visibility for the flight and the ground
likely conditions
the reportes in the aicm ubicaban right conditions the tens , with is the aeronave towards the worrying area between the df and the state of mexico made drainage of nubosidad to low level
seleccionadas routes
is likely that the conditions of nubosidad tripulación has buscada a area of will course and greater visibility towards the valley of cuernavaca
location the impact
the coordenadas of impact and the last registration of the aeronave the radar obliged , probably before the impact not there loss of control or at in the background of flight
dispersión of remains of the aeronave in a area reduced
the available information to the time it mean that the impact happened in a straight background and of hand
the patrón of dispersión of remains of the aeronave it mean that the hawk impactó in the ground in conditions of structural integrity
not has been fact of ceasefire or explosion
in the website the are are revelarse evidencias in the remains of the nave of some kind of explosion or ceasefire
the last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground
for the jobs of field have found parts of the aeronave to a course of 9 thousand 200 feet on the average level the sea , the ground is a outstanding which is since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of gradient
the photographs are the sequence in the which expected desarticuló to what long of way
the information provided elements which seem indicate that the hawk could have had multiple impactos in the ground
after of the thorough search in a area more wider that the acordonado website , around the accident , not have found parts over of the aeronave , what which strengthens the presumption of that the impact presented in conditions of structural integrity
mss is protocol to finding gene of
aimed the sure social a research to be the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is out in specialists the
the institute participate the sure social ( imss ) announced that aimed a research to be the gene of the obesity in children and people , of protocol &apos; genética of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , which will have with artistic marcadores the obesity
in a release , the head of the unit of research médica in bioquímica the hospital of especialidades the centre doctor national century century , miguel cross valverde , he that taken a multidisciplinario team of doctors , nurses , nutriólogos and social workers
team is out specialists and a of postgrado the institute national of health public ( insp ) and the centre of research and of studies avanzados ( cinvestav ) the institute politécnico national ( ipn )
in the research foot to participate to the population be or not derechohabiente , come to the units sporting ensure the imss in the valley of mexico , where have to out the evidence to the age , all the lottery to from of the 8 : 00 hours
upgrading that the protocol started in the unit deportiva ( cuauhtémoc state of mexico poniente ) and which since the 8 of october , the activity has to out in the unit deportiva ( nezahualcóyolt state of mexico east )
a time which having the aim of together to 500 or 600 age , the study continue in the unit deportiva independence ( south the district federal ) and finally in the unit deportiva morelos ( at north the district federal )
he that the purpose of this research is know the components and the importance of the genetic with regard the development of the obesity and identify in children and mexican people factors of risk to prevent the emergence of chronic diseases degenerativas
the held this 14 of november the day world of the disease , precisó that the aim is together to three thousand children and young between at and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , to the implementation of specific cuestionarios on food
also them preguntará on the physical activity and heredofamiliares background of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk which desencadenen padecimientos as disease or renal inadequacy
detalló that the lottery them applies to all the mediciones participants antropométricas ( weight , stature , circumference of cintura ) , take of many pressure , determination of the levels of glucosa , triglicéridos , colesterol and insulin and genetic ( seeking identify genes which asocien to the obesity child )
cross valverde pointed that this research regard to the concern of the professionals of the health the alarming increase of weight in the age
&apos; the surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 open that in so only six years there a increase , in the case of the children , of 77 cent in obesity , and of the girls of 47 cent ; in terms of obesity also observed a dramatic rise &apos; , upgrading the specialist the imss
pressed that the justification to the search of the marcadores sustenta in that the population the country from of others their genetic history
informed that in average , the participate has 65 cent of inheritance american indian , 30 european cent and five cent through and this condition is in the genes which take to disease and too of weight
he that of general way , the genetic of the obesity translates in the inability of throwing the too of energy which consumimos ( ) lowcalorie and which transported in way of blubber
the researchers he that the direct benefit to the participants is the due assessment of the children , what which allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity
even , said , presence of pliegues of obscuro colour ( acantosis ) in bottleneck and antebrazo , which show the likelihood of that padezca metabólicas alteraciones and to prediabetes
the information expose of confidential way , the doctors the entregan writing to the parents , to who them explains every one of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life which must to to prevent diseases
cross valverde he that there three main components which cause obesity , obesity and others crónicos padecimientos : the sedentarismo , which is the lack of physical activity daily , remain the greater part the clear day with the television and use media of transport in place of moving distances planes
also must to the high ingesta calórica , is say , the greater consumption of azucaradas excess , of ( carbohidratos tamales , bread , pizza , clones , etc ) with high content in tallow and protein and the genetic which analysing in this protocol
stains of the unam evitaría
raphael herrera , researchers of the faculty of química of the unam , develops asfaltos gm with polímeros to produce a with better course , regardless of the environmental conditions and of
if the signals which are the pavimento are met , not would necessary reparar closely of 200 thousand pretty every season of dry in the area metropolitana the valley of mexico , warned raphael herrera nájera , researchers of the faculty of química ( fq ) of the unam , who was that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a asfáltico pavimento is the appropriate , the pretty could reducirse in amount or , even , be complete
in their conference a technological opinion of the pretty , dictada in the framework the international year of the química , was to know that the laboratory to their office develops asfaltos gm with polímeros to produce a with insignificant characteristics to the the stains , but with a greater resistance mechanics , therefore to highest as to dribs temperatures
herrera nájera estimó that this kind of asfaltos gm could used in places where the climate is extremely warm , as some cities the north the country , to improve their course and , what therefore , the training of pretty
he that the stains , the part more heavy the oil , is a whole of moléculas of hidrocarburos , a of high molecular weight , on asfaltenos , and others of under molecular weight , on maltenos , which north you are to pavimento their characteristic viscoelástico behaviour
the viscoelástico behaviour the stains is in that to highest temperatures , closely of the 180 degrees , means as a cosmetic , to 120 degrees degree their viscosidad is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest , while which to temperatures very lowest , the stains again quebradizo , added
what previous means that in the streets the resistance the stains not is uniform , but which is constitutes for the day of agreement with the environmental conditions and of temperature , warned the specialist in engineering chemistry
the researchers of the fq observed that the streets of the city of mexico in their majority are covered flexible pavimento , the which consists of six drainage of materials , of the which the last three involucran the stains
between the drainage more superficiales is the asfáltica carpeta , conformada small bañadas stones in stains and then compactadas
every a of the piedritas which is the carpeta , pointed , is bañada with stains
the transitar the vehicles and generarse efforts , this allows that the forces are very well in the pavimento
if like of stains that difundirían still best , did the engineering chemical
on the asfáltica carpeta , abundó , put a last layer called carpeta of rodadura , the which is pale of a material of fine stone , is say , a bit which also baña in stains
as is of the layer which is to be in contact with the llantas of the vehicles , must have more force mechanics that the asfáltica carpeta and provide fricción in the way
the be the part the pavimento which is to receive and salvage the efforts , the carpeta of rodadura required , also , have the thick appropriate and must they the material the which is pale
the climate , especially the moisture and the shift of temperature , also are a factor very important to be , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the course of the asfáltica carpeta
when the ground humedece , the water disseminate in the interior of the carpeta and is difficult that it , this results a reblandecimiento of all the drainage the pavimento and , what therefore , the training of pretty
in the process of training of a bache , said , the first in desgastarse is the film of rodamiento and only after affects the asfáltica carpeta , but the damage not happens instantáneamente , but which is a process which should atenderse to the first signals with suitable programmes of peacekeeping
the also member the system national of researchers he that the vehicular burden is another important factor in the training of pretty and , this , the thick of every one of the drainage the pavimento must go always in relationship with the vehicular burden and ensure that having , to avoid that train pretty emotionally
raphael herrera warned that still there a which investigate and work on the stains , example , the asfálticas emulsiones , which in other countries already are even in the market and it reparar the pretty with easily and need of use highest temperatures
what you meet to the cresson the valley to be the new señorita colombia
analysis of the factors which incidieron to that melina ramírez serna not alcanzara the nickel of señorita colombia
the valley receives their title number 14 of princess
of new the valley the cauca is with the wish of the nickel of señorita colombia
this time melina ramírez serna had that shaping with be in the podio of ganadoras , lucir the nickel of silver and the bandwidth which acreditan as new princess of colombia
with the agonising result anoche in cartagena , where the señorita atlantic alzó with the nickel and the cetro , the department already adds 14 titles of princess and melina a to the legion of vallecaucanas women which have been closely of the nickel but that were proclamas princesas between them of ospina benoit ( 1947 ) , clara domínguez borrero ( 1949 ) , from bellini ayala ( 1979 ) , daewoo álvarez ( 1981 ) , rose mary alzate ( 1983 ) , olga maría arenas ( 1987 ) , leila blanque ( 1988 ) , mónica evers ( 1989 ) , maría consuela pinedo ( 1990 ) , diana isabel romero ( 1993 ) , giselle garcés aljure ( 2000 ) , catalina giraldo ( 2007 ) , stephanie garcés aljure ( 2008 )
today the great question that many do is what meet
because the result represents the defeat of a great favorita which in every presentation proved that it had everything to be the new señorita colombia , not in vain was elected lies of the police and best face jolie of vogue , titles which were reinas as taliana vargas or natalia navarro who were the nickel of señorita colombia
the first factor which as key in the decision which took the jury of first designarla princess as in that not convenció with their answer to the question &quot; what is that book which you has separated to you and what ? pale martín murillo gómez , of the carreta literaria leamos
the interrrogante the vallecaucana did
&quot; read much , i quite in the literature , i that is a way of culturalizarse , definitely i that the book which i espoused of childhood is &quot; the principito &quot; , is a book quite shared
currently read &quot; crime and punishment &quot; , is a book of universal literature which all we read ; and today in day am read the book of irene nemirovski , a russian , a hermosísimo book which is &quot; the ardor of the blood &quot; &quot;
a answer which little was first the term &quot; culturalizarse &quot; and second not explain of particular way of what way every one of the books which citó the have separated
but at conclude the ceremony melina manifested sentirse relaxed and happy with the result &quot; the universe is sabio is what which has that to
and to all the people , favour read a poquito , &quot; the principito &quot; is a great book
between the outer hipótesis says that to valley quemó the favoritismo
a bogotano journalist insinuó that the be the respected , the ovacionada and the cresson which was all the hypothetical prizes ( challenge of gastronomía oster , vote the public the best suit notions , and lies mother ) , &quot; that kindled the celos of the other candidate , estresó to the lies and that not brilló in the stage &quot;
and that notó in their first presentation in suit of bathing in the a the hilton and their two desfiles in the evening of coronación
although in two lució safe , notó that you missing the force and the impetus which the representatives of magdalena and atlantic deployed
ariel osorio , journalist the programme &quot; as in home &quot; , the channel rcn did that the fact of that melina would designada princess &quot; fallen that the cresson which more prizes earns for the contest not is as lies &quot;
also , valley was to what last very esquiva with the press , and equivocó
one hipótesis is that valley not issued to the jury on their interest towards the social work , which is in last , the essence the contest national of beauty
something , two days before of the election the international jury lucy doughty manifested that them buscaban a comprometida woman with the social needs of their pais
&quot; the single beauty not is in a miss colombia , there that look region beyond of what physical and look in their social sensitivity , that before of imply the contest are already involucradas in projects &quot; , he
also especula that valley pecó their flaws in the derriere and the fibrosis which you notaba in their abdomen , but is contradictorio because precisely the jury the was as the &apos; cresson natural beauty &apos; with the body more healthy , good food and physical work responsible
the preparador of reinas borg hernán orozco recognised that melina not had the best body , which had best , &quot; but their problem of fibrosis in the abdomen , which the truth to my not was very notoria , you bowed points in the last day &quot;
between therefore the journalist guido hoyos , of the magazine cromos as that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the quirúrgicas speeches which practicó
&quot; the cirugías are well , but valley not was do
their body never was their as and here cobraron &quot;
this prize , which first time entrega the contest national of the beauty , after the parade in suit of bathing did a vaticinio which anoche perform , because said that this was the contentillo which raymundo you concedía to melina to not should the will of the nickel
reality or not , what true is that melina since today starts a year of reinado , not as sovereign , but as princess , position which you offered the possibility of represent to colombia in one of the international certámenes designation the own contest national
however , it will to the history as a of the reinas which to despite of their arrollador step cartagena , you was esquiva the nickel
was the work the caleño which designated the cadáver of alfonso
a lofoscopista of cali happened to the history as the man which confirmed the death of &quot; alfonso cano &quot;
the work of these officials is key
the last 4 of november a lofoscopista the cti of cali happened to the history as the man which confirmed the identity the the head of the farc : &quot; alfonso cano &quot; , to through the cotejo of their digital fingerprints
of the seven lofoscopistas which laboran in the seccional the cti , that week you tocaba the time of &quot; availability &quot; to eliazar gonzález , a man of tejada port which has 21 years working in the area of legal research
the to their career , gonzález worked in municipalities the chocó , where many sometimes had that internarse more of five days in the jungle to come the website in the which were the bodies which be be identificados
in the 2000 found to the capital the valley and , then of to the appropriate courses , especializó in lofoscopia , which is the study of the fur of fricción , is say , of the palmas of the hands and of the feet
the week the operational against alias alfonso cano to eliazar you warned that bring minimum clothes to three days
large something you expected
the friday in the night went to the cauca in a hawk since palmira
was that should identify two bodies and which sospechaba that one of them was the man which respected to the guerrilla more former the world , what which you were that bring the decadactilar card of guillermo lion sáenz ( their real name )
however , when came with the team of research the website in the which was the cadáver not recognised their physical aspect , because was very different the that had seen in the media of communication
was barba , a as a bewilderment of the area , glasses and much more young
but the fingerprints not mienten
linked of a galtoniana lupa , tinta , a transplantador and a linterna , eliazar comparó the from fingerprints the cadáver with the of the card
their eye not you falló : was &quot; alfonso cano &quot;
that same night , the oriundo man of port tejada was the responsible of confirmarle the minister of defence , john iv pinzón , which itself was the the head of the farc
in search of the
to a dactiloscopista of the sijín of cali the recognition which was the president john manuel resort to eliazar gonzález , in the wheel of press the operational against &quot; cano &quot; , is very significant
very people not known our work
the dactiloscopia is a accurate science , margin of mistake , which can come to be key in the resolution of crimes
apart of the identification of bodies , the lofoscopistas support research crimes as hurto and murder and bear the identity of the capturadas people
when arrested , many criminals have wishful cédulas or not have papers
us them we the impression dactilar and the look in the basis of data
the researchers counted that , in a case of hurto , you tocó denied a part of wall of a home , because in that place the aymara had supported their hand to from a strong box full of joyas and money
&quot; the walls are difficult because not are apropiadas land to from a impression dactilar , but in that case we obtain the imprint of all the hand and identify at criminal , which had participated in different hurtos &quot; , reminded
the fingerprints also can seeking or reaffirm acts in cases of murder
ago little found to a dead man , with cabin of licor to their around
of the research determinó that a family could be using the crime and , indeed , a imprint in the bottleneck coincidía
although this not does that has been the murderer , ubica in the scene the crime
a dactiloscopista the cti he that in the items &quot; the fingerprints sacan with reactivos chemical or physical &quot;
when receiving , used a transplantador or tape to levantarlas
then of this , the from are settlement to the asif , which is the basis of delincuencial data , or to the registraduría
&quot; the problem is that still there many xenophobic columbians &quot; , pressed the expert the cti
aclaró that not all is as shows in the programme of television csi
as not all what which make is gold , not all what which is again imprint
however , if can be usada , if do the dynamic cotejo
the indignados &quot; &quot; defy to authorities in new
hundreds of demonstrators get to the square zuccotti to acampar
a great part atendió the order of desalojo and found to a paruqe have
the those the movement ocupa wall street desafiaron this tuesday to the authorities of new york the try of into of new , under the under of a legal order , to the square of manhattan of where were desalojados of attempt and the try of should another park of the britain manzana
hundreds of demonstrators get to the square zuccotti , where wanted access thanks to a legal order which allows to the indignados &quot; &quot; return to acampar in the place , while which another part the movement did the desalojo may a park more the north of the city , where has there new arrests
&quot; our idea is that , if the court not we allows return to acampar in the square , we we to installing in some another place and continuaremos the legal battle return to zuccotti , as to through of sentadas and peaceful demonstrations &quot; , said one of the for the movement &quot; ocupa wall street &quot; , mark bray
bray detalló that the answer of the indignados &quot; &quot; the desalojo of their camp dictated personally the mayor of new york , michael bloomberg , came to the courts , where the jueza lucy billings issued a order which prohibía the forzosa evacuation the place and did to the demonstrators to is acampados
also , the indignados &quot; &quot; procedieron to the occupation of a new park it in the confluencia of the céntricas channel street and the sexta avenida , very closely of the entry the tunnel holland , which unite new york and new jersey , and property of the used of trinity church
the least for a time overpower should the place , but after the police turned and were to stop to some of the demonstrators , although bray not could confirm the concrete figure , while was to efe which was to several journalists that were also esposados
the organisation are that are several hundreds of people the which had been in that point , where already has desplazado a delegation of religious leaders in indication of support to the those the movement and which has with of mediar with the police
between therefore , the square -que zuccotti is a recinto of property privada- still closed to the waiting of the since of a legal view due to this same tuesday in the which must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this attempt
some of the desplazados demonstrators to portaban and repartían to these hours millions of that legal order and even the entregaban to the players which custodiaban the square , what which was &quot; some small clashes &quot; , pressed bray , who deplored that some uniforms propinaron coups to the demonstrators
the legal order prevents to the authorities desalojar to the member of ocupa wall street or apply &quot; laws that publicaron after of that mismanage the occupation or ban to the demonstrators access of new the park with shops or other properties which using previously &quot;
the mayor bloomberg pressed to the press that , because to that legal order , the city had suspended the reapertura the space the public and to the demonstrators , to the which alerted , however , which the local laws not them it go to installing with shops of campaign and sacks of taking
the regidor campaigned personally the desalojo open to out of attempt of the square zuccotti , a operation in the which were to around of 200 arrests and which decided because the demonstrators were &quot; continue the law &quot;
bloomberg he that was the order of evacuar the square because this was becoming &quot; in a place in the which the people not venían to protest , but to have the laws and , in some cases , to do damage to other people &quot; , already which &quot; some business habían reimbursed threats &quot; and the neighbours temían &quot; their quality of life &quot;
&quot; the desalojo of this attempt was asqueroso and shows that in the fund bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests which the of the american workers &quot; , added the spokesman the movement , who was the mayor of &quot; faltar the respect to the freedom of &quot; expression
the those of &quot; ocupa wall street &quot; indicaron also that think organise &quot; large actions &quot; to the thursday in cooperation with organisations comunitarias and trade , to commemorate the two months that takes the protests , that started the 17 of september

the canadiense pamela anderson has been the assistant of bennett allen in &quot; home improvement &quot; , socorrista in &quot; baywatch &quot; , conejita of &quot; playboy &quot; , the wife the musician of diplomat tommy yew and now , the actress and model will the desecration maría in a particular of christmas of the canadian television
the private channel of television ctv announced today that anderson , with with the &quot; crooner &quot; ( baladista ) michael bublé and other leading canadians , will in the programme of &quot; television it &apos; at to russell peters christmas &quot; the next 1 of december giving life to a very particular desecration maría
ctv distribuyó today images the programme of television in the which anderson , also known the wider distribution in internet of a casero video pornographic in the which is with with their then husband , the battery of &quot; mötley crüe &quot; , tommy yew , is vestida as the desecration maría is in a pesebre a muñeco which represents to jesus
in the scene , peters , a known cómico canadiense of origin indian which recently actuó as presentador in part of the about &quot; mercy violent torpedo of truth &quot; of charlie sheen , is as josé
also of anderson and peters , the special navideño of ctv has with the canadian berber bublé , which to end of march married in aires with the various model luisana lopilato , and that not is strange to the controversy
recently , bublé phoned &quot; zorra &quot; to the estadounidense kim kardashian for one of their concerts in new york
japan renace after the
the overall gdp a 1,5 % thanks the successful consumption and being end to the spiral of caídas which set in
since the last month of march the japanese economy was paralysed , still convaleciente the devastating earthquake that became in a nuclear crisis , the worst disaster which padeció the nipón country since the ii war world
the first estimates the government of tokio cifraron the substantial losses in 300.000 million of dollars , a coup which , despite the difficult context world , seems have atenuado
after of three consecutivos trimestres of caídas , the fact the product interior bruto between july and september was to to website , definitely : the gdp incrementó a 1,5 % in compared with the previous quarter and a 6 % in anualizada rate
the as in the second quarter - to the japanese , the year tax begins in march of 2012 - is , also , the greater pace of growth since the period of january to march of 2010
the recovery explains , in part , the repunte of the buying of machinery to restored the asoladas areas the seísmo and the of tsunami
of done , the companies by their investment in a 1,1 % , with the drop the 0,9 % in expenditure of capital which observed of january to march , the first positions after of six months of ininterrumpidas hikes
however , the real revulsivo of the japanese economy not is exclusively in the new momentum which foot to take the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure , servirse of the shortcomings to grow since zero
japan has reawakened , on all , thanks to the development the successful consumption , which in the today represents the 60 % the japonés gdp
this one escaló a 1 % , empujada the increase the expenditure in vehicles , travel and activities of leisure

the cdu proposes choose the european president universal suffrage
the first day the congress of the union cristiano-demócrata ( cdu ) , the monday 14 of november , in leipzig , has appropriations difficulties to merkel merkel , chancellor and madam the cristiano-demócrata party
initially not had including in the order the day the future of europe , but the issue imposed in autumn , in particular to satisfy to the fighters which feel that the policy the government is currently too little strict with the greeks and could become in a future with the italians
the motion on the presidency of the commission european , proposal the direction , adopted virtually unanimity
of the 1.001 delegates , so only registered nine votes in against and ten abstenciones
the standing ovation of several minutes which ganaron , with their speeches , merkel merkel and , after several hours , wolfgang schäuble , the eurófilo minister of finance , despejan any possible doubt
the key idea of the chancellor , and of the motion , resumen in a motto : the answer to the crisis &quot; not is least europe , but more europe &quot;
not only because europe is the peace , but also because &quot; nine million of jobs on directly the euro &quot;
to the chancellor , &quot; has come the time of open way in europe &quot;
this could expressed in amendments the treaty of lisbon to allow strengthen the control of the union european on the budgetary policies of the countries of the area the euro , although also could desembocar in the election the president of the commission european universal suffrage to &quot; should a face to europe &quot;
in all case , that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted the congress , clearly idea of wolfgang schäuble
doubt , is little likely that the veintisiete come quickly to a agreement on this radical change : britain britain shows hostile to he and the leaders of the cdu seem know that nicolas sarkozy also
but the demand is on the ground
another hand , the delegates have rejected a overwhelming majority the proposal of ponderar the weight of every country of the directive the bank central european in role the weight of every economy , what which obviously reforzaría the weight of germany
ansiosa calmar the encouraged in the interior of their party , the chancellor has increased the no to konrad adenauer and helmut kohl . but not is that has tried gain to their congress to at of the small &quot; &quot; european countries or of the countries in ready difficulties to criticise to the arrogant germany
although the motion on europe he a paragraph to the importance of &quot; the franco-alemana friendship &quot; , merkel merkel not has mentado to france
salvo of last
thinking that , ago two centuries , in a bloody battle in leipzig
of done , was one of the derrotas more humiliating to the army of rostopchine
the impact the fraud in the dribs
after the benefits , the ump and the government emprenden a attack against the dribs disease
nicolas sarkozy will the tuesday 15 of november in bordeaux to visiting a responsible box of the benefits family and use a speech on the issue , already topical since 2007 , of the fight against the social fraud and the ayudantía
also , to restructure as attack , that part of the will of save of thorough way , but still reminds to a which of the presidential campaign of right , the majority want look in the dribs disease
in first place , to apply budgetary cuts : the government for impose to the workers the private sector a fourthly day of we before of power catch the lower
in final , unless that there a convention of specific company , a worker that caiga ill lose four days of wage , is say , a minimum the 15 % of their income per
is of a measure which could its a wave of ira , but which would save 280 million of eur , according them echos
also , would accompanied of another measure with a reach more symbolic : impose to the officials a day of we pay in case of lower labour ( to the time , not have we , with to the three days that apply in the private sector )
while debaten these issues , the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud , this time looking towards the abuses of the dribs labour
&quot; van to incrementarse significantly the controls and , also , if discover to someone planned a fraud , must reembolsar the cuantías &quot; , warned xavier bertrand talking in the rtl the sunday 13 of november
the as which in the other cases , the effects the announcement seem slightly desproporcionados to the reality the fraud in on of dribs labour
of done , since 2002 do a constant monitoring of this question and have it various offensive policies which , normally , have given as
the french not enferman more that in the rest of europe
handed with attention , in first place , the national figures
according the french institute of the social security ( cnam ) , in 2006 abonaron more of 237 million of eur in particular dribs labour
according the french institute of research and documents in economy of the health , the benefits the dribs representaron , in 2008 , the 5 % the expenditure health , ascendiendo to 11.300 million of eur
of this sum , the 46 % is to the dribs leave and accidents labour , while which the 54 % is related with the dribs disease , figure which amounts to 6.200 million of eur
therefore , the 2,5 % the expenditure in health
in 2010 , the french have cogido a average of 14,5 days of lower labour , with to 17,8 in 2009 , according a study the group soul consulting
a average which , doubt , is government : one survey , published in 2007 the view of professional management monster.com , mostraba that the 75 % of the 40.000 french workers encuestados rushing that not had cogido not a only day of lower disease
another study , in this case of the maladie assurance , in that in 2010 the 37 % of the dribs disease had a an less to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more long
if the compared with our european neighbours , the french workers not are more propensos that in other areas to catch dribs disease
a long study out in 2010 two researchers the cnrs given that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of global lack the work ( therefore reasons of health as of another kind ) oscilaba , in france , between the 10 % and the 11 % , with to a 20 % and a 28 % in denmark , a 15 % in uk uk or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the countries netherlands
the fraud in the dribs disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not undeclared
the fraud has a reach quite limited
the forward of the legislation , since 2002 , has caused that the controls of the dribs disease of more of 45 days are sistemáticos
in 2008 , of 1,5 million of inspections , the cnam comprobó , in a 13 % of the 285.000 by , which the dribs of shorter an were unjustified &quot; or too we &quot; , is say , 37.050 cases
in the case of the dribs of more of 45 days , untreated to sistemáticas inspections , was that the 11 % of the cases were &quot; rightly adaptados or injustificados ; a figure which , taking as starting a total of 1,2 million , amounts to 132.000
therefore , high a total of 169.000 &quot; cases injustificados &quot; between several million of workers which cogieron a lower disease
doubt , a minor figure in compared , example , with the work in black
according the member of the ump dominique tian , author of a report on this question in june , that practice will a losses of income tax of between 9.000 and 15.000 million of eur the year , is say , more that the total cost of the benefits dribs and , doubt , significantly more that the fraud in this last area

policy energy
the facts must assert more that the
if there a issue which not can try taking in account considerations of short term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy
the availability and the cost of the electricity have directly in the power you and in the competitiveness of the companies
is appropriate that a electoral meeting be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the nuclear energy
the debate only will useful if investigated the whole of the economic consequences , social and environmental of the options proposed
the french must resorted their opinion in made objectives , in rational data
now which are 7.000 million of people in the planet , the demographic development some the duplication of the demand we before of 2050 , to least which prive to a huge part of the population world of a vital element
the same time , will that afflicting the shortage every greater time of the fossil resources to continue have electricity continually , forget the imperiosa need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse to fight against the change climate , a issue which has disappeared the ecological debate
the accident of fukushima not change none of these parameters
that , germany which single in their decision of up to the nuclear energy
that not is the case or of belgium , which hearing the their to the need of find a capable source of sustituirla , or of switzerland , which only has aim build power of last generation
another hand , britain britain , finland , poland , republic czech , countries netherlands , sweden , south , china , india and brazil , quote some examples , are forward with determination with their projects
the states united , their hand , after fukushima you add a unit to their park , retomando the construction of a interrumpida central after the accident of three mile island
if the german model , based in the renewable energy , is in times as example , the reality is in against of as speech
the election of berlin is to mean a encarecimiento the price of the electricity , a greater dependence energy the incrementada need of gas imported , in particular of russia , a increase of the emissions of co2 the construction of power of gas and of coal
in a months , notarán the harmful effects
must meditarse on the case of denmark
campeón of europe in the eólico sector , the which this the 30 % of their electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the intermitencia the wind ; this reason , their emissions of co2 and the price of their electricity are , respectively , a 65 % and a 50 % more high that the european average
the otherwise , thanks to the information of our policy energy , our neighbours abonan a bill of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the french homes
while which in a globalised economy the cost of the energy is a key factor of the competitiveness and a guarantee the peacekeeping of the industrial usefulness in the national territory , the french companies from of the electricity more cheap of europe
that reason , any significant reduction of the nuclear energy contribute a strong increase the price of the electricity , what which restaría realism to the maravillosas statements on the reindustrialización of our country and the defence of our power you
is of a price which the great majority of the french refuse to pay and , of fact , not manifiestan opposition principle to that kind of energy , that are the surveys
remember that the policy energy of our country has lost build a industrial sector with 125.000 jobs of director work and 410.000 indirectos jobs
widely looking to the export , encompasses a galaxy of pymes towards in the international markets and which can create jobs not deslocalizables
if france decidiese leave the nuclear energy , contribute the sacrificio of great part of these smes and the loss of the 6.000 million of eur year in french exports of equipment and nuclear services
what electricista encargaría a epr designed to work sixty years , when is to the collapse of their manufacturer
to put equation of the nuclear energy , there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity , the as which not there a diabólica source
the development part of areva of solutions with lowest emissions of co2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the complementary nature of the sources of energy
in the case of the nuclear energy , is essential keep the the level of security
in france , have of a authority of security which by a narrower control and transparent therefore on the power existing as on the construction of flamanville
our equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also more the security
in half century , the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents
so only one , the of three mile island , in in a operational conditions normal ; not was consequences or to the people or to the environment
in chernobyl , the accident was the design the reactor and to a human failures imperdonables
in fukushima , some people seem forget that the accident was to two natural disasters of a unprecedented reach , which caused the death of tens of thousands of people
the nuclear sector aprenderá of this accident , as as was of the two previous
thanks to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and french builders and german , the epr is a capable design of resistir to such phenomena
while what estudian all the electric players which want build a central , the interruption of their construction in flamanville would a great gift to the competitors of areva and edf , since which them cease free way to taking the leadership in the inevitable development the nuclear sector
is essential and legitimate seek the best energéticas options to our country , but would irresponsible stop that the statehood , the dogmas and the partisanas volume dominasen a debate so important to the economic situation , social and financial of our country
the immigration , a burden or a opportunity to the economy
the policy of immigration applied nicolas sarkozy has been criticada on since various points of view : the saturación of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the compatibility of this policy with the autoproclamado statute of &quot; country of the human rights &quot; of france
more recently , is the administrative harassment of the foreign students the which has saltado to the headlines , with the minister of interior ( véase the newspaper libération the 23 of may ) proclamando of past that france &quot; not needs foreign talentos , workers or camareros &quot;
however , rarely time analysing since the point of economic view
the question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the left and the right
in the case of the right , jacques chirac fijó the it declarando in 1976 that &quot; 900.000 unemployed not should be a problem to a country which has with closely of two million of migrant workers &quot; , while which in the left , the tone fijó michel rocard explicando that france &quot; not can have office of all the misery the world &quot; in 1990
the only difference , the degree of
in 2005 , therefore the left as the right compartían the fear to the invasion the national territory a a of fontaneros poles
to both both , as that the immigrants are a burden to the economy and the french society
the only difference is in the degree of generosity with the which act with regard to the immigrants
in their programme , mitterrand hollande limited to include banalidades , those that the codesarrollo will put the &quot; problem of the migration &quot;
this idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is profitable electoralmente , but economically its very you
such as guarding the economists ian goldin and geoffrey cameron in a recent labour which like the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( exceptional people : how migration shaped our world and will define our future , may of 2011 , princeton university reporter , 352 pp . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the positive impact of the migratory flows in the economic growth , the wages and the employment in the countries which receive immigrants
the manner of the immigration it the growth and is the employment
the fears about with the impact of the immigrants based in the idea of that these can replace to the national workers , in particular to the little specialised , pressing to that reduce their wages
but the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well additional which substitutes of the national workers and who mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment
the little immigrants specialised working in sectors which not get to national workers and the more specialised in dynamic sectors where the training not is the demand of staff
a positive effect on the
from same way which a vladmir would difficulties to work in a country which have lack of anestesistas , the complementariedad between national and migrant from that the arrival of these last invest welcome in the wages and the employment of the national
taking in account what previous , giovanni peri calculó that a increase the 1 % of the migratory flows is a increase of the real wages to long term of between a 0,6 and a 0,9 %
and , have in account the fact of that the diversity which aportan the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the economic growth ( there a great proportion of prizes american nobel naturalizados and companies as google , intel , paypal , ebay and yahoo were degrading ) immigrants
the immigrants also are net taxpayers to the social systems , since which aportan of average a 1 % the total budget in the european countries
the international organisation the work estimated , example , which in germany a inmigrante which comes with a age of 30 years conducted a neta contribution ( least income expenditure ) of 150.000 eur to the public budgets of average for all their life
the principle of their mandate , nicolas sarkozy wanted go to seek the points of growth which you faltaban &quot; with the nail &quot;
these nail , which disuadieron to the immigrants , had exactly the reverse effect
europe invented the democracy , only you missing think in a european democracy
the democracy is a good precious , but also fragile
the european continent should be acordarse of this already which , although invented in athens ago more of two thousand years , to what long the century the has suffered the tragedies of the war world , totalitarismos , the holocaust , the roots , but also to franco in spain , to salazar in portugal , the coroneles in greece
some perhaps believed that , to that the democracy triunfase definitely on their enemies , would enough exercise the vote and the way more direct possible
know , since rostopchine &quot; the of &quot; , which was of something although
the universal suffrage , although is of a necessary condition to the democracy , not is enough only and even can become in a &quot; instrument of oppression &quot; , as said most the republicano filósofo etienne vacherot
not , the democracy required much more : a public space , a public spirit , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , lights , economic solidarity and social , justice
the crisis which live in europe is a economic crisis , but is to point of a in a political crisis and democratic
the palinodia the greek referendum verdadero-falso had , to this regard , a double effect demonstrates : was the need of a return take of the political sphere , but also the worrying feeling of their alternatively , of their inconsistency
must reflexionarse on this ambivalence to superarla
the truth is that the lines the with of the democratic battle currently have desplazado and that , in many cases , the republican soldiers already not making in the good sense
not saldremos gaining if we a catalogue of national referenda , problematic in role of the needs and of desordenada way
a signing in white the european monarca all or a high the which the nacionalista hole : ¡ what options to the citizen
not , not want from coups of effect , but a common exercise , of plenary right , relaxed and ongoing , of the options and the democracy , this time to european level
not there crisis in greece , italy , spain , portugal ( of fact , not sabríamos where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of europe
the entire of europe is the which pliega to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , which the which suffering their powerlessness and their lack of solidarity
is the whole of europe the which suffering a humiliation in the international sphere
we into the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but is all europe the which lose slowly the sovereignty and , with it , every one of their nations
what more urgent is that the popular sovereignty restore the helm the european project
because only together will the europeans reduce the weight of their debts , liberarse of the markets and preparation their future by the investment
the exit of the crisis putting decisions to european level which not will be a democratic legitimacy total , unless that be to conducirnos the disaster
after have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of jacques delors , all the world calls in the today a economic governance european
that be
but think in it a greater political integration and democratic , and that be vivida as such the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new dead point
we taking a new stage of the european construction
to build the republic in france , was be &quot; do republican &quot;
the revolution motivated interests not would enough
this lesson still being applies
we build a europe more an since the point of economic view
only will achieve build a europe more democratic in the political level , a real popular sovereignty european
to build europe , let europeans

to get the higher , not however , is necessary that the banks the reach to available of their customers

the banks proves the payment mobile telephone

from sahara to nigeria , the terrorist operating is in
paris are the ties between the tass in the islamic magreb and the secta boko haram
the ties between the terrorist group the tass in the islamic magreb ( aqmi ) and the nigerian secta of boko haram , on the which sospechaba since ago time , have confirmed
the sunday , the argelino viceministro of affairs foreign , abdelkader messahel , even said that argel already &quot; has the certidumbre &quot;
&quot; the way in which both organisations operating and the reports of the services of intelligence shown that are cooperando &quot; , he , provide more details
paris seems come to a similar conclusion
the research on the hostages of two french in niger the last january would pursued the pasarelas
raptados in a restaurant of niamey people relating with aqmi , antoine of léocour and vincent delory died the next day with with wounded of their secuestradores for a operation replaces the special forces french
in the rubble of the intervention , the french researchers and nigerianos as several telefónicos chips which been to the terrorists
which
the study of the on by in towards several partners based in mali , niger and nigeria
according radio france internationale ( rfi ) , two numbers captaron especially the interest of the researchers : one leads to a nigeriano which permaneció for a time in maiduguri , a city the north of nigeria , cradle of boko haram , and the one to a man which , supposed , is have to aqmi and to the secta
&quot; is of a progress , but doubt we wait to poseer evidence more formal before of speak of operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram &quot;
&quot; but is possible &quot;
&quot; know since ago years which secta have of financial support and intellectual foreign and that every time is more active &quot; , says kunle amuwo , a nigeriano researchers
these last months , these &quot; support &quot; had found every time more clear in the development and the speeches of boko haram or in their operational case , which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosivos equipment every time more complex and the same lifestyle which category aqmi
the international community , beginning washington , is since then pressing to abuya to which have in account the problems have boko haram
the grave authorities , of fact , have time considering the group as a community of iluminados little understandable of interest
a rapid success
up in 2002 in maiduguri in on to a mezquita , a school and the imán fundamentalista succession yusuf , boko haram ( which means , in hausa , &quot; the western education is a pecado &quot; ) , spreading to the both of a islamic emirato in the muslim north of nigeria
in this poor region , the partnership is living a rapid success
politiza and requires a narrower respect of the sharia , while which their fighters killed to the fight against the central government impío
these last orientan in first place to the churches , the televisions , the administrations
in 2009 , the fighters of boko haram were especially active and multiplicaron the attacks against the comisarías
the reaction of abuya was , as is to , widespread
the army atacó the city and registered 800 dead
succession yusuf , arrestado in life , receives the death in prison
since then , the secta radicaliza and abandon their feudos the north
the big holidays , eye a attack which cause 80 dead in jos and , after , one in abuya
in june , boko haram again to attack against abuya , in particular against the general barracks protected of the police , with a suicidal attack , the first of this kind
in august , the local headquarters of the nations un becomes in their first international aim
the creation of a which terrorist in africa , which abarcaría since mauritania to somalia happening nigeria , concerned to all the specialists of the security
while which aqmi has undermined mali and niger and that the somali of al-chebab operating in kenya , boko haram arises as a new threat in the centre the continent
the last week , for a meeting in nigeria with the president goodluck jonathan , alain juppé you has having against boko haram and has claimed that was ready to &quot; share all the information &quot;
the world that republican candidates to the
in relationship with china , with iran and with the aid to israel , mitt romney , herman cain , and rick perry vying in simpleza and lack of knowledge
a debilitada america the crisis , can manage a complex world with simple ideas or , even , simplistas
listening to the republican candidates to the presidential , the electorate could think that is
since ago a days , mitt romney , herman cain , rick perry and the other candidates every time do more estruendosas statements and atajos in on of foreign policy , traditionally a strong point of the republicanos
extienden the lemas , to often infundamentados , on china , iran , the aid to israel
mitt romney , the best candidate it in the career towards the designation the &quot; cardiff old party &quot; , has threatened with to to the chinese to the wto and denunciarles &quot; manipulation of their motto &quot; , a key issue in a exasperada america the migration of fragmentos flows of their sector towards asia
just if that means the explosion of a war trade , said
jon huntsman , former ambassador of obama in china and the only candidate which has a sofisticada vision of the foreign policy , almost ahoga to a attitude which &quot; apabulla &quot; the emotion
has asked a clear dialogue , but equivalence , with beijing ( the current position of obama )
but huntsman , which is reached in the day of the polls , still being inaudible
the lifestyle of
romney also has promised a military intervention in iran if the sanctions not achieve find their nuclear programme
&quot; if salgo elected , detendré to iran &quot; , fanfarroneó
&quot; if obama its reelegido , will the bomb &quot;
promised also increase the military aid to israel , acusando to obama of have failed with their obligations in relationship with that partner
the entrepreneur herman cain , the second best candidate clasificado , shows their part a embarrassing lack of such subjects
recently , instaba to counter to the military threat chinese because beijing &quot; is develop nuclear capacity &quot; , apparently carrying the fact of that china already at the military átomo since 1964
the governor tejano rick perry , that supports to israel and want intervene in iran , says that , their part , is ready to orbiting the army us in mexico to fight against the which of the drugs
the appeal to the torture against the supposed terrorists , outside obama in 2009 , also preconizan cain , perry and the cresson michele bachmann
the differences are considerable with the republicano candidate of 2008 , john mccain , a heavy weight in foreign policy
the opponents the current president contestan that reagan also had simple ideas and which won the war cold
are that the own obama was a amateur and which had that aflojar the piston in on of fight against the terrorism
insisten , with reason , in the failure of their ingenuo dialogue with iran , in the imperative exit of the &quot; boys &quot; of iraq and in their tergiversaciones in libya , and etiquetan of weak
but the attacks not them are court
the population juzga of a way more well positive the balance of national security of obama , which is with laden laden

the nord stream , new door of entry the russian gas in
the pipeline nord stream , which comunica directly western europe with russia happening the fund the sea baltic , already has since in service
must supply gas to satisfy the needs of or million of homes
gazprom , the russian gigante the gas , has wanted there the event with great pompa
the last tuesday , more of 500 invited , including four heads of state and of government , took to on the baltic , between the music of the orquesta and a delicate bufet , in the opening the nord stream , the new pipeline which comunica directly , under the sea , russia with germany
symbolically , the german chancellor merkel merkel , the russian president dmitri indication , the prime french minister mitterrand fillon and their homólogo of the countries netherlands , mark rutte , have girado together the volante of the válvula which controls the entry of russian gas in the network of western europe
with this new pipeline , every year that 27,5 million of cubic metres of russian gas additional to western europe to through of a first had of 1.224 km that comunican the region of st petersburg with the land of mecklemburgo-pomerania
a second tubo should concluirse to end of 2012 which will supply a total of 55.000 million of cubic metres of gas , is say , enough to cover all the french consumption
also , already about of the possibility of build a third tubo the same way
to gazprom , the completion to time of this huge labour is aires of victory
poland and the countries baltic had are strongly the project
of done , the nord stream is to allow supply gas directly to germany , preventing the course third earth countries ( poland and ukraine )
of coup , these two countries some something of their power : to them , will more difficult influence in russia amenazándola with cerrarle the access to the markets of western europe
in the álgido point the debate , warsaw not dudó in compare the nord stream as a &quot; new germano-soviético pact &quot; , in reference to the alliance between hitler and stalin to should poland in 1939
is say , if the issue is politically delicate
western europe , support the russian project , has obtained a greater security of supply
but the price is a weakening of the europe of the energy , given which the project has led a gap between the europeans the this and the west
russia has who , in so only five years , do triunfar their vision of a direct alliance between russia and the western countries rich , large consumers of gas and with a reserves every time more limited
&quot; this pipeline is a component of our partnership with russia , a new arteria which we unite of conventional way &quot; , confirmed mitterrand fillon for the opening the pipeline , proving to what point the contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic
all this explains the broad smiles in the sides of the superiors of gazprom , many in lubmin , in the point of arrival the gas
the construction of this pipeline also is a technical achievement
the tubo submarino is made of recubierto steel of cement to protegerlo against the anclas of the ships
supports in the fund the sea , to a per of 200 values of depth
to construirlo , was necessary avoid camps of mines which dating of the second war world
&quot; was necessary fallen or destroy a centena of them , caution &quot; , jens müller , spokesman of the society nord stream
also , was necessary providing the measures of protection of the parliament and the flora
the tubo is a long word of metal which pesa as 242 torres eiffel and not is cut in all their length : or válvulas , or stations of peacekeeping
was due a platform of control in the waters of sweden , but the responsible the project renunciaron to the same at see that the swedish not were very ready to allow that a society russian state estableciera of permanent way in the sea with to their coast
&quot; in case of avería , interrumpiremos the step the gas in least of a minute &quot; , there jens müller
in case of flight , the gas the pipeline liberará , therefore , to the atmosphere
but the builders feel little likely that would a flight , since which have proves junturas which , according the forecasts , will a flight every 100.000 years
the control the state the pipeline does by a submarino robot , arrastrado a per , which do external inspections , as by a recording which restrict the interior the pipeline
with the way of a puro , introduces in the interior the tubo , which has a distance of a metre , and at with the gas
to their arrival , after three complete hours of journey to a speed of three second metres , supplies precise data on possible deformaciones the metal
the pipeline has been representing to work for fifty years need of no kind of reparación
the movement the gas does simply the pressure
the principle is of 200 bars and , to the exit of 100 bars
five companies have joined their forces to be to to out this project
the company leader is gazprom , which has the 51 % of the cautiously
to it , unieron the german e.on and basf ( 15,5 % every one ) , as the neerlandesa gasunie and the french group gdf suez ( 9 % every one )
these five societies have created a common company , called nord stream , encargada of build and exploiting the pipeline
has their headquarters in zoug , switzerland , where the taxation is especially favourable
after , gazprom alquiló to that society , for a term of how renewable years , the entire of the capacities of transport of gas
&quot; to gazprom you paid the total capacity , regardless of the amount of gas which really transport &quot; , there jens müller
the funding of the construction the pipeline has taken just in a 30 % with the contribution of the accionistas and in a 70 % by loans banking
the total cost of the labour should achieve 7.400 million of eur to the two tubos
to gdf suez , example , the investment has reached the 240 million
but the weaker accionistas are sure of that not superarán their investment , since which gazprom moderating itself only the risk of the expenditure
the pipeline emerge the baltic in lubmin , in a at arenosa plantada of pinos
a válvulas , with 4,5 metres of level , form the door of exit the gas
there a sensors which miden the pressure , the temperature and the specific characteristics the gas to the arrival , before of that owed to the german pipelines
since the last tuesday , the terminal receives one million of cubic metres of russian gas every time
to total capacity , will three million time and in 2012 , six million

but there a party which playing and a rival , bosnia , which defeat
taking in account the party of adi ( 0-0 ) , the friday in the hell of zenica , seems clear that the thing not is proactive

the as which in zenica , the versa iran with the intention of exercise , since the principle , a pressure paramount on the bosnios to &quot; not dejarles time to think &quot;
a good idea , always which , this time , be realistic
