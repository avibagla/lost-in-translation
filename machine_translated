&apos; only the half of the children have that that have five lunches cares according the regime : ? , lunch , food , and dinner , that is a of the conditions in for a healthy &apos; , - one of the results of the survey .

The specialists of that , in a development healthy , are important , also , the details , that also have , as by example have a time set for the ? in family .
In saw , not However , only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren to the same time .

Among their food records are the , the meat and the

the attention , by example , what for to the , where many children to the water normal and aware .
The children also with more often in the the meat of and the fish for the food main and the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of .
The has of be also a good currently , people the professionals
In the Article , How about the , already I a little of that the lessons initial already were quite .
not had and idea of how would for .
of three professionals the , how he to - problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world the spectacle .
And will worst .
geographically more close are the with end , more information and tasks practices us
And but the course develops each Saturday and Sunday , already not is a .
We time have examined with the there , , ( in the course not there no man ) on how he to the woman that not has a perfect .
And so is the great majority .
. is , someone has a on without the right and someone suffering obesity .
The has of know possible a shoulders , a bottleneck or the necessary
We have given certain noticed on how to I the body of women the kind of oxide , of and enormous but close and the same time not of a way too
If , by example , the difference between the and the is so that the Speaking or the trousers not , is the worth done the least a paper of Russians to measure .
, doubt not , because the clothes that where perfectly is .
With a Speaking to measure having a better that with a that not for of get , , in the , and
The body can allow he clothes with , , or .
There certainly many types of information various and of bodies , so that I back of that have of all the week for to order in my head all this information .
E even so , I afraid that with the task , already I more that of too .
each participant in the course to have allocated two famous , to the that must has two : one for the day and another for the night .
There that have in account the aspect current , the lifestyle of fashionable that to the person in question .
I has &apos; he &apos; to Kerr , perhaps the of the campaign of Victoria &apos; &apos;s .
by within , for me is a better that , by example , or , that recently will a hundred 75-kilo ( by favour , have in account the That ) , or the .
The I we that of the weeklies or in Internet and , for after wholeheartedly .
The , that is as is the result completely , This also our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design .
is important also think in the part the .
The , by therefore , not only physically , but that also is , by example , of the pages of products in the weeklies ( of subjects specific , as trends , , coats , and ) .
all this us spoke the and leather .
But all this already is for the Sunday .
The has of have a vision global .
The three invited specialists him the conference the Saturday with information on all kind of bodies .
The , the leather of fashionable and the of fashionable Ben .
us reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the should from party to this .
And a good know work with a same of he of forms various .
The is , in this case , fundamental .
So , the such ( or as say in English , ) can he to what hidden with and , but also the for he the body asking with the of and as if it in reality a clothing .
Or well enough and go the bottleneck for obtain a image completely different .
&apos; with this &apos; , us role .
What that more is the next board : &apos; For start to work , ago lack that first all the rules &apos; .
&apos; Then already &quot; &apos; , said .
end I is clear by what all these Interesting , what being with what , by what , if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable us are results different .
That without about of the .
Thank the Ben , I that a has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that is .
So , for a history of fashionable that have ten pages ( by therefore , ten ) , there that have right , lists for use , the least fifteen .
And also that the photos the clothes works in combination with other , all them different to the that overnight in the reality .
All this there that mind in account to the time of has the .
us was that the image and the lifestyle People them alone , in many cases , the half the success .
only look to , that not is precisely a as extraordinary , but the image and the have fact of it a star world .
In saw , by the time , not there still a trend clear to use the services of the .
far the - famous also what are pointless ( I mere my skills , my aspect physical not has so importance ) .
And when someone us our services , there that have in account that is very likely that us a enormous very different to the their real ( will ) .
Then only is and told if the weeklies the heart already have writing on the issue , if a certain has / , and
The Sunday , and us in that the not to enough in the fashionable , but that has that understand of .
During their work , on all must communicate with the people to the that , by what that is fundamental be a good currently .
responsible at to the people , not ago of least , for their views .
&apos; When a there you for that to the and what with fine , not &quot; take and baby all what that had and say : &apos; what horror &apos; &apos; .
&apos; the least a couple of things that and recommend for that someone the can to &apos; , says .
He same also us was that all must in the so-called &apos; &apos; , is say , the stock of work .
This set around of the and have there all the tools necessary .
are items as nail , as nail , , or . There also will of ( that to the the for the session of photos of products such that or ) , special of of by front , if this outside greater ( the and another kind of not are , therefore could damage the fabric ) , or a at of remnant .
For not slogans in the much and to something in practice , have learned to the of the the .
Even for the part-session of photos in the study , in a surface world , could damage the and a more still the foreign .
And not did more that and .
not stage must the the with the nail for not by accident .
So that had that be very .
I has given a joy the who my work without reserves .
The truth is that not I are very well these skills .
This is only a small part of all the that have heard for all the end of week , in the second part the course .
already I I given account that producing the to level professional not is a way of themselves , but I of exactly as what that fairly the people .
In for : The need by all America .

A journey , in principle , complicates to cause of a series of of a journey routine for the time of morning .
In certain measure to cover the expectations , but this not the of nothing , if , in reality , not intended to nothing so .
The new over , to the that the title adds The , up large expectations already before of their .
that would new to the former of to for and , to result of what shown , is as a at that not should end being other time a gender of action without more .
also us we by know how than the scenes , where the like main falling the car and walking by their own ordinary .
As is This in the of , the results not an great thing on to what that us been .
There to that can to by tonnage , but in the total Some points to cause of failures absurd , that already come in the series since ago years .
In reality not can and blend errors , but that is more well of the incomprehensible of the .
The adventure at very well .
you predictability in a history , whose leading , as , has certain problems personal ; for , to does participate in a career illegal by all America .
the in the at in , in St Franz , and tardiness.&apos; mission is to the first to New York .
The idea is to something interesting .
The route into in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty to .
this follows that each career has place by a route different and the stages are in different forestry , that are quite various and interesting .
that way , one not has and the that of that the at will always what same .
Some of the forestry are even to the view , but the level technical the is equivalent the of evidence previous of the series .
therefore , not is nothing the another world .
But the through by the desert , the landscape or the highest mountains covered of snow are a effect about very atmosphere .
In , the to of time in when by a element .
So , by example , in the desert you a storm of bit that sad the visibility .
In change , in the mountains there that have care for that not you a .
According that , each a of the to is very well developed .
only there a couple of models , but with that enough .
During a time , to a amount of rival ( what normal in a career classical ) , after of win time ( resolved hidden ) and then you expected a resolved against a only .
In a of all this is to sometimes the police , that not ago but prison still more the things .
The - are the landscape outside the car .
have when as , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and you.&apos; you that , always the fair in the time fair .
Nothing complicated .
It surprising , without However , that has enough least landscape in the at of what that be wait ( in particular there only three ) .
But the result end is positive , because this element not is to be people and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements that do that the at it more interesting .
The model of severe still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous .
That to say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not can that that be There .
If a realistic , already &quot; to in other part .
But to a career should with quite action to appropriate quite this lifestyle of severe , but we find something better between the games of the competition .
far here , all in order .
But the problems emerge after of a true time .
difference of what right of the models of severe , already not is what same with the another .
games of this kind not is wait that and another complicated , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not &quot; predict how prosecution , with what which not all is in order .
is typical that , the to a very or able the prosecution with a traffic normal , so only has commercial , but in other situations almost identical , prosecution has doing .
Or even has completely destroyed .
Thank the system of , not emerge large problems , but can of is humour .
The are of such way that , when a accident or you of the back , the at you the last point of rescue in the back .
, However , in each career only that of five available .
If the all , you that restart the career since the principle .
So therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not be well , but not is very of .
sometimes , and the aid , only aid the the stage in of memory .
A great disadvantage the at is that the ourselves facts are in different places .
In some , by example , there that into of a way specific ; of another way , are being of take .
Others sometimes you in some website vehicles &apos; civilians &apos; always with the same configuration , but the first , or five minutes before or after .
This ago of on all in situations , when that two that will the meeting in directions opposed , your without problems , but when , or well where .
is as when , because is speak by that the &apos; surprise &apos; always will front of military .
The adversaries have also a advantage more .
During all the starting to websites where , without have in account the time , always you the same in the same website .
In this is the end of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is still more .
must to before that you.&apos; , the price that be .
When is front of you.&apos; , you difficult the vision of the that come of with , so that the principle &quot; to the car .
can understand the idea of create a at with maximum takes of and , but the execution is so Apparent that surely you delay .
And is a worth , because but the model the journey be simple , the at is fun and with action , of way that to often not is possible to the detail what that is and where .
And really of as , if the merit has the idea with fifty runs features or the classification in the career for that not the is , or any other thing .
A idea is the change of for the to .
a that be stress to the of petrol the hand of the road , because exactly there you that change of prosecution , but in the great majority of the cases you A what that you .
The into in three categories .
The &quot; are adequate for areas urban , the strong Americans for the motorways and the for a severe technical , by example , by roads of mountain with .
In will main also is a will of challenges parallel , is say , there to in places specific that by the stories .
here not only European , but also points of experience for profile , that the therefore for the challenges as the .
At achieve the level higher , the driver to open several for , beginning by the prosecution and with funds for the profile .
At same time , there a role in line , that it results with the of other players and other duties Community .
One of the elements more difficult of understand is how is nation the last career in the history .
With the car to the tunnel the metre ( and ) , where you to is to aspects by the to ( and ) .
The you mark between 150 and 200 km / at ( and ) and , of suddenly , by behind you is the the metre and you has by front without more .
In the significant surely we a discussion on this for several days , on if for the programming the at none was even a little or if the authors of truth us take by a buffoons of .
The part technical the at not is nothing so , but the least the effects general are in the majority of the cases , to sometimes to .
Well what worth that , in the at more reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a way serious .
This affects on all to the accidents where there many participants , when the quality of image continual already not is along .
The audio is well and the on is a question of observations .
end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth , the on belongs to the category &apos; each one of their father and of their mother &apos; , but can mean that nobody enlightened the at only by their music .
The that end of for : The is therefore quite confused .
If the at errors absolutely stupid , us we problems in that that The is the better at of of the last years .
are the that of that the at not is concluded .
The is , but because the errors you come in the eyes with the force of a of airport .

The her to the EU , :
The Czech have a ensure of and To .
&apos; The treaty of Lisbon has affected significantly the balance between the institutions individual &apos;
&apos; not I than that a war without Guardia &apos; .
&apos; five , six years , before of that the situation a little , and the new players to their new in &apos; , so began with conviction their conference in the had of law the her Czech to the EU , .
How not issue in seriously their motto &apos; clear and openly on Europe &apos; , that said already in the first part of their conference , when to under each body of the EU and their relations with such precision and clarity , therefore would the of many Greater of the had of law of the .
also the work of the new President permanent the Council European , will Rompuy :
&apos; What first emerge the criticisms , that if is , a official grey , capable of in any role , but I of say that with to all is , because here their role to the technology &apos; .
&apos; is a man that know listen to the Member of the bringing states , communicate with them and that has a vision of towards where must go the EU &apos; .
The new since of representative of the Policy External and Security is to from of the question : &apos; ? Who is this EU ? ? what number I ? &apos; . is therefore of a step important towards the unification and the clarification of of the union policy of face to States as China or India .
Nobody to the cheese of
has occupied also of the agenda was , still and will the Council European in the future next .
The presidency Czech of ago two years was a success .
The Czech raised of the crisis economic he , worked the crisis the gas and organised a summit for the Partnership Eastern .
The fall the government in time time lighthouse as a aspect very negative , that back seriously to saw .
The representation Czech in the EU has by the time many commitments .
In words of the her : &apos; a good in &apos; , not only the presidency , but also the crisis financial , that is trying now .
another hand , there that approve the budget for seven years of the EU , caused by the current situation economic , a more complicated .
If the budget is more simple and effective , ? what sectors will priority , what countries will greater support and what least ? That is something that will present in the agenda of the next meeting .
The her reminded also their main , with the that was to Europe : &apos; of Europe with clarity &apos; .
&apos; What true is that not I them the , the or the that the people not understand &apos; .
&apos; ? How can a citizen understand that in Brussels not busy of truth the curvature the curvature or , bananas of various Organic or that nobody us is to ban the cheese of ? &apos; .
also is from more from the environment of the EU and closer to more citizens Czech to the institutions European .
We expected the Europe of the multi-speed
According the her , the Czech have reputation of To and the people is more well the aspects negative that the positive .
In , the low participation of the Czech in the institutions European .
The fault is of a of factors , as the of our candidates , their inability for write messages of motivation , but also the little support of the Czech .
In the success of the presidency Czech , it of highlighted the force and the cooperation the Group of .
&apos; that when who to me a Polish and a Hungarian and I about a Slovak , a French to my hand I says : &apos; ? What , already away been , the the Group of ? &apos; , and is that not to ago no grace &apos; .
In the future , to the EU , according , to new regulations of policy budgetary for the States Member .
is as something very real the concept of the two multi-speed , if not are more , in Europe , more that the new of &apos; the Federation European &apos; .
&apos; We countries in the and countries outside of the &apos; .
&apos; We the space Schengen and we also the procedure of cooperation from &apos; .
&apos; said by first time that only the countries that want and the that not , that no outside &apos; .
&apos; These procedures will each time more and The the Europe of the two multi-speed &apos; , expected .
In this sense , also skills the role of saw and of will Rompuy in the implementation the principle , according the which all the subjects that affect to the whole of the EU must discuss between the states Member , not only between the Member of the .

then in their case can say that go of purchases has become in a vice .
Some women are account that should appease their by the purchases , by what least a little .
But to see , ? what woman could the temptation of wander without more by the shops of clothes , to well and after all in the ( in all colours different ) ?

How have which the prices of the travel since 1989
far 1989 had in the Czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state get : , , , and .
The agencies of travel of time time in the majority of the cases travel only the bloc socialist , therefore the travel to West were very .
The tourists Czech would , by therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the Then ( Republic Democratic German ) , to the Union Soviet , ( in in the Sea Black ) to Bulgaria and Romania ( both in the Sea Black ) and to Hungary ( ) .
A exception positive was the period for between 1962 and Programmes , when could travel to Yugoslavia , without However , after the regime towards the in and the travel of the tourists Czech were then quite .
A great - the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc socialist ( or be , also to the ) not them travel free and financed and even by the countries socialists .
If a citizen wanted travel financed , by example , to Poland or to the Union Soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the journey individual not was possible .
The agencies of journey in those times also travel the East , but one should to to the EU with a together of our and to so all the night , or have &apos; good known &apos; in the agency .
yet so not all was cattle .
The so-called &apos; promise of change &apos; that was the condition for the travel the East , not to the &apos; people politically little reliable &apos; , that so not could travel in , .
The currency not was a currency freely Police and , without guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency Western ) for travel to West .
The great majority of the Czech experience their holiday in their own country , by what that had a great number of borne and houses of summer , that the Czech . This in still there .
The way of travel of the Czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution .
While that to 1989 for us was the not is more to the holiday in the Then or Bulgaria , the year last the Czech did 4.5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world .
It great - , of the that today day already not are aware , the fact of that the destination currently with , Croatia , to 1989 not could travel freely , because was part of the Yugoslavia of then .
principles of the years 90 imposed the exemption of visa for travel to the States neighbours of Europe Western , what that resulted a wave huge of visits of shorter long-term , to Vienna or Germany .
The , for a time , not his of the the East , all the world wanted see the what least by a time .
example , in Paris the groups of Czech in the parks in shops of campaign , already that our income of then not us pay a hotel or pension .
A feature typical of the Czech of time time was the be for the food ( canned , small , and ) for save .
Another time important was the introduction of the of the crown Czech , so our tourists could finally , after of decades , buy freely currency Western .
Our level of life and with he also the wages means , what that around of 1997 resulted a increase in the demand of travel .
With the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies , to from of 1997 with issue , to for the travel using the further of flights , what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thanks to the possibility of obtain contributions by the volume of passengers .
end of the 90 the century last , already the Czech long without visa to almost all the countries developed , exception US , what which still more our travel .
Another time interesting in the history the tourism happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thanks to a huge demand , the first flight direct since saw to a country , and was to Thailand .
Since time year , proceed all the years flights direct with tourists Czech was countries distant and . This winter already directly since saw to 12 destinations .
The countries the their currently close of 100 billion Czech the year .
Another time interesting of this time , that symbolises our development , was in the year 2008 .
The 17 of November of 2008 , US squeezed the visa for the tourists Czech , with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world .
In 2008 the Czech , by first time in their history , have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( % ) and by first time in their history , have located in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion Czech by head , including the expenses in the website of stay .
House General for choose the President , that could end of new in point died .
Since ago almost five months the football Czech is without President and is likely that the successor of Safronov as President of the Federation Czech of ( ) , not and after the call of the next House General that will place this Thursday in .
fact , still not has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to to .
, the same , not will vote even for choose between the three candidates .
The interested to the football Czech are , and .
to their office in June not without before convene to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that so the football in the future .
, However , after of conclude the was , used a controversy between the two of the partnership unable of to to a agreement for always a candidate common .
This became in fact the 16 of September when had that be elected the new President .
The naturally of the House General met in vain in the House National ( ) , on in the area of , because the discussions had blocked and not only in as the method of election .
not was to no consensus and in as to who in the House General had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the naturally with full powers .
from of that time and because to this only point , in a agreement - , supported also by the recommendation the Institute of State and law , according the which the representation by full powers not is possible .
, However , the disputes on the code electoral are open .
than light on the situation already not could should and the Committee Executive that , in their meetings , or extraordinary , essentially not Preah nothing .
The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the point incapacitated still being the same .
The question is the next : ? of what way to in the third round for avoid the point died ?
&apos; The dispute This in about to if must to of agreement with the or find another model &apos; , says , one of the three of the , that , since the direction of the partnership , represents the professional .
According the model proposed in the , in the third round going time candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy .
The Region of caused is ready to to to a compromise for that can win time candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both .
The part , without However , which the condition of that the winner , according these are , should have the majority of the least two thirds .
&apos; This to , without However , the sense to the two rounds previous and by completely the concept of system &apos; , so is as understand the concerns of the part , according what which what better would not must the order and vote according the Social .
With what said , surprisingly , is of agreement also , but is that the regulation electoral established by the of all the candidates appropriate more to .
&apos; I like that the maximum of agreement with the &apos; .
&apos; For that not no about of the representatives as in the last House General &apos; , says the you of Victoria , that by first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of .
still being positive .
According he , in decide on the new President and he believes that the candidates in the future of way served .
&apos; All the with the party of today of our team national in the European .
&apos; The football will to be leading , and so more to will &apos; says the representative the , that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to level professional as regional .
is the more reticent .
&apos; I that it to a agreement , but , by Unfortunately , the situation is a more complicated . &apos;
&apos; not is the conflict between and , but there see of the rules to their own convenience . &apos;
&apos; This can have as result a new deadlock of the House General . &apos;
&apos; all any , hope that with the sense common &apos; , said .
already not is a time for that all the parties are to a agreement .
Some negotiations had that take in Montenegro , but ? who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely ?
The on special , in the that had that travel to , between other the and , not has out this morning by problems technical in Prague , taking that other a alternative for carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification .
the meeting decisive , by end , could be the that will place to level ministerial , that , according have , will this Wednesday .
, minister of Education , Youth and , to like a integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country for that it to a agreement .
There a in at : the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next House General the Committee central of the federation the sport ( ) that one need of a new direction the sport Czech after the problems financial of the home of .
by achieve the presidency , because not is a candidate more for .
If the head of the of , , before of the House General extraordinary the name of a candidate for that all their ideas on the new President of the Federation Czech of ( ) , and would as candidate to a since so relevant .
&apos; If would a person appropriate , would fighting by it and not I would as candidate to the elections . &apos;
&apos; But to the day of today not has been find a person so &apos; , said for the Agency of Czech ( )
What that could to to into in the challenge with and is exactly the possibility of say to , the course winner of the elections , that opens the way to the presidency of the Federation Czech of ( ) .
also that , in case through , in the office of President only to 2013 , when ground the time of the assembly general ordinary .
In that office to like see to a expert and good asked that not is too related with the events certainly .
&apos; already I about with some people to the that could have in account &apos; .
&apos; For me was a madness hear to some say that in this time and even want way with the football Czech . &apos;
&apos; I like change that vision &apos; , adds .
What that supposed more bother to in this time is the relationship of with the President of the Partnership of Regional of survived , a man with a last controversial , known outside the as a with capacity of influence in the vote of the naturally in the assembly general .
For is so unacceptable see to at in the presidential .
&apos; In case of that , keeping the status to and nothing in the football will &apos; .
&apos; With the support of , a man of business ambitious , the football surrendering still least from &apos; , said .
also the fact of that ago a years the name of was e-commerce with a much telephone for the research of a case of corruption , of the which went .
&apos; not I what prestige the football could bring the victory of . &apos;
&apos; And with what eyes us fresh the UEFA and the FIFA &apos; , said , that also decision-making with certain caution their statement previous that &apos; the Club if become in President &apos; .
In the case of win the elections the Thursday , could be the cooperation with in the future .
same opinion is the another candidate , , that has been supported by before of the House General of September that end in a .
&apos; He ( ) would the first the that confinement &apos; .
&apos; is very capable . &apos;
&apos; I what could imagine , by example , as head of the representation &apos; .
&apos; but not as asked of a partnership &apos; .
&apos; I not the there where not I I capable &apos; , added , that in September very attention by support the from of the Commission of by , potential after by .
The that to manage the partnership .
to their capacities of management of the companies private , therefore since the summer last is also the Director-General the , that with their support took in May the in first division .
&apos; I force for change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe . &apos;
&apos; For reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably tend to influence in the decisions the committee being and of appeal , have situations become , said without so their towards the President the Daniel .
A of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the and the Committee , with the aid the which pressure on the leaders political for that programmes more money the sport of the tax of the I .
&apos; is one of the problems key the that should for the new President . &apos;
&apos; If the tax on the games of gambling , as what the parties political , would their arguments , but , pursue , have that us where is to stop all this money &apos; , out .
, now not has in account even their partnership with the Club , but he same says that the President of the must be &apos; not in &apos; .
is to their time e-commerce with and with of Prague .
&apos; not is ideal . &apos;
&apos; But not I sense the fact of yield preach my actions the Club of to other person for then again there after a year and a &apos; , said .
promised to the new that with the point died of the elections .
Two days before of the House General of the Partnership of one of the candidates to the presidency , , promised that , in case of be elected , effective that the had a new that definitively for as , in the future , the controversy in as the regulation electoral .
The representative the is positive in as to the meeting of this Thursday in , and believes that the conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football .
already before of the elections not made in September , promised on , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in it funds .
participate in the last minute in the last assembly general , by what that this that of two months to could go well for defend and to , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management the football .
&apos; The people of all the levels is the football already ago a time and expected of this Thursday the new President . &apos;
&apos; that has come the time of that someone the partnership &apos; , of the man that Not mainly with the Club of , but that worked in the and in the committee executive of the Partnership .
this reason , believes have enough experience for manage the football Czech .
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that atmosphere in the time of Safronov .
&apos; Unfortunately , in the House general of June were adopted the that not were so planned as all run-up . &apos;
&apos; If certain interpretations , we a President already since September &apos; , emergency .
Lisbon the the document more important of the Partnership as for who to the naturally .
&apos; If I President , I what counts as a challenge personal and I prepared to respond in case of that this . &apos;
&apos; is a question of principles , without the which not we There &apos; , says .
In , in theory , is not over with their opponents .
already in the last had your that there asylum with , the that respects by their training in law , being aware of that their would also their first Vice-President .
already was a time without attack to owed who , the contrary of , not with pawn with head .
&apos; a more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes . &apos;
&apos; Their attacks but were and very people became amazed by the campaign electoral . &apos;
&apos; that many of them on their real nature &apos; , said to their Maracaibo , that still being faithful to the statements announced already in September .
weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , since the &apos; more in to the with .
This last should be of promotion the football .
&apos; also , as all the that overview to cause of the as result the scandal of corruption the year last . &apos;
&apos; immediately after I in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , for ensure that has enough money for all the football &apos; , said ago two months to the the candidate of 46 years .
continuation also promised that their Members as President the football not no amendment personal of the .
&apos; should that of first the tasks of each he &apos; , said things to where , after a long period of , has a incomprehensible .
despite of the scenarios at current that to the next assembly general , he believes that the naturally not travel in vain this Thursday to .
&apos; If the only point of are will how vote in the third round , without doubt what we overcome .
&apos; The football needs credibility , the which will only if by end has a leader &apos; , still two days before of the &apos; more decisive in their career of representative , still being positive .
promises , that under their leadership , the to work with to .
If in the quarter House General its elected the current Vice-President as new President of the Partnership of Czech , very people very surely .
promises that , in case of be elected , hard .
It implement a change systematic and to that the Member the committee executive are responsible of each area the football financed .
also compromises to to the case of the , improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA , get more money for the football and continue with the work on by the previous President Safronov .
&apos; As President , I like producing by completely the football &apos; .
&apos; Since the contacts international with the UEFA and the FIFA to the selection , and by the football professional or the training of young of high performance . &apos;
&apos; With this not I say that what would all only &apos; , said in a interview for the .
&apos; I a player of team and I over the powers the committee executive of such way that each Member can who to a area should . &apos;
&apos; And tasks difficult for that the football can , in each one of these , to on with a momentum &apos; .
&apos; very people this probably not to , because move start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others &apos; , added .
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement , says that has have the possibility of not stand of new as candidate .
&apos; all know , that work 20 hours cares . &apos;
&apos; But need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that I – and to each step &apos; , he so the reasons of their .
&apos; Many people I has said that not I address by Source , because then give by also the others &apos; .
&apos; is of have faith for not leave so , without more &apos; , said .
According say , to could also continue the work that already began with .
&apos; During these two years , end a great part the work that not I that now vanish &apos; .
&apos; are processes that had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not I like that someone the &apos; , announced concerned by the fact of that , if the another candidate , , the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of .
&apos; I I in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , not is capable of keep .
&apos; conceals of he is on all all that people that the football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected . &apos;
&apos; I can a lot of things , but not the fact of that I to favour of someone . &apos;
&apos; I be aim . &apos;
&apos; I to a football for all , because only so well all and not only the elected &apos; , said .
rejects also the idea that only serious Karlsbad the President .
&apos; Although some people seeking that what contrary , I in mind to what maximum by caused . &apos;
&apos; example , is time of think in the fact of over the second division in a part Czech and in other , whose winners to the first division &apos; .
&apos; not would the situation current in the that we only three equipment of caused , what that represents a problem for the players young &apos; , said .
Although to the of the elections presidential , President the Club , not is of believe in their for of be elected .
&apos; still I have a strong support of the Federation Czech , the which I was as their Vice-President and that know that behind of me there successes clear &apos; , said , whose successes understand the savings of a tens of million of billion of contracts , the negotiations of contracts and the negotiations on the law of the I .
another hand , recognised their part of fault in that the federation not is united .
And while civilized that is &apos; for to the confidence in the football Czech &apos; , as the another rival , , as a candidate strong that itself has something that to the football .
&apos; Nobody can for that was a great work by the time year &apos; .
&apos; In the case of that be elected , probably will what that already began Safronov and not of way significantly the the personal in the forming . &apos;
&apos; not I use that to my favour &apos; , so to their rival .

The threat concrete
After the discovery of &apos; the Just of &apos; , the means of communication Turks the state of right German .
A newspaper about of a &apos; ideology bloody &apos; that again to .
The for of eight small employers noticed and Greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a Repression of the extreme right .
In Turkey and in the population German of origin Turkish has reacted with fear and concern to this news .
For many Germans of origin Turkish which a that died ago time , since the attacks with way of fires in in November of 1992 and in in May of 1993 , not had happened more episodes of violence with Repression of extreme right against Turks .
not However , never has Some that in Germany there xenophobia .
The network discovered reveals a scale whose dimensions not were , and a least , .
&apos; ? to the ideology bloody ? &apos; , the edition by Internet the newspaper Turkish &apos; &apos; .
The newspaper &apos; &apos; by the contrary that one of the authors the crime was a – of the Office Federal of Defence of the Constitution and shows concerned by that the authorities German can be involved in the .
The community Turkish in Germany with , the end of week reminded to the victims of the violence racist with a to the of .
Two weeks before , the community Turkish in Berlin with with the political Germans and Turks in a act formal the fifty anniversary the agreement .
The them it in scene with much colours , as a history with end happy .
The information was to some means Turks as a : &apos; The gift German by the fifty anniversary &apos; , says the title of a Article in the platform Turkish of Internet &apos; sheet X &apos; , things the Repression of the chain of for .
The emission German &apos; &apos; not to in out this connection mental .
&apos; starts to quite is &apos; , says the title of the spine of .
that the killed were people that their tax and did a important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany .
In the body of Internet of Germans of Turkish , the behaviour of the police and their and success in the Statute very shall .
The authors of that the authorities German not have a before suspected in the proving of the .
One shows as least given in as to the means : &apos; from of now here lose , to the immigrants not them is more that the self-defence and the arms &apos; .
&apos; This will the better &apos; .
&apos; The peace internal of Germany on are of the quality of the case and of the adequate of the penalty to all the network &apos; . , it &apos; &apos; .
What that means that , if the peace internal of Germany is in danger , the attacks of and in 1990s years .
The image of the ruins the fire of has incident in the how German and Turkish .
No another entire was more clearly to the Turks that live here that there a threat concrete and , to the Germans , that the mistrust and the distance can in the violence .
The attacks the sense of group of the part Turkish .
not repeat the errors the last
In the press Turkish criticism then mainly the swathes of the policy German after the attacks , denies to visit to the survivors of .
After the attack with way of fire of sent a of condolences the President Turkish and , their minister of Affairs Foreign , what in the of Cologne . in their speech what that contribute with the tax the Turks of Germany .
It clear how estimated the value of a person according the amount of their tax .
The information current of the means Turks again to show what much that is , since then , the mistrust of many Germans of origin Turkish in the legality of this country .
In the effort of a explanation wider and of a the terrorism of extreme right in Germany , this time do lack words .
The bank the scandal the of
The bank more of Europe not is in Italy and France , if not in Switzerland .
The almost on in in the crisis financial and since then of a crisis to the next .
now the at a German .
will that spoke not what had thought .
After of their witnessed starting of the summit the bank federal , in July through that in 2013 in a new and almost also of witnessed work : President the board administrative the great bank much , a and lucrative step in their career .
spoke am should , endorses Switzerland by their beauty and to the by their would acquired strength and is fall comments on their will colleagues .
&apos; The how has achieved a up &apos; .
&apos; I am cooperate with and &apos; .
In September became clear that all would completely different .
A with financial of the how in London blackout all the systems of security the bank and 1.7 billion million of EUR .
, director general of the how , a banker not only known in Switzerland , had that come .
The President the board administrative of the how was since then also , and all be : ? When is spoke ?
through that spoke must necessity the bank since February of 2012 .
And will office of the presidency the board administrative in May , not to principles of 2013 , as the bank the Tuesday .
This is hard for spoke .
not is banker , more well , a of economy and and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary .
coup ago responsible of the strategy of a bank , that has of again to prove that deserves the title &apos; the greater bank the scandal of Europe &apos; since ago time .
a part , the how is huge , to ago little was the greater administrator of goods world , and by other part , since ago years , of a scandal the next .
Nothing , so what seems , to the changed so proud bank much .
started the crisis financial .
The how had a reputation excellent to 2007 .
The image the administrator of goods much and much , but also , with objectives ambitious , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investments .
a part , with ones billion of dollars , the how being more money of customers wealthiest that any another bank the world .
And by other part , as bank of investments in the Politically of the large banks the world .
This .
Hans , the former banker and and a of in for many years is : &apos; with my students , always I described to the how as model of a good bank . &apos;
&apos; Since the point of view current , one question : ? How could ? &apos;
was in a great mistake .
In the year 2007 went to the light that something went very is in the how .
the of year , better , director general , that to then was have as a banker and very intelligent , resigned surprisingly .
Some months after , the reason .
The fund of investments the bank in losses with titles of high risk and had that thousands of million .
For shoulder with this , the how announced a of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of FRF .
For this found investors , course that some with They to little before : a fund state Asian and of Singapore and a fund state Arab , so , that never had heard their name .
This was only the first coup .
In April of 2008 , .
The bank had that on the loss of thousands of million , , President the board administrative , in 2006 in the Secondly better paid board administrative of Switzerland , resigned .
In October of 2008 , she the disaster , in view of their investments wrong , the found in the crisis financial to the collapse and had that be by the state .
The bank national values problem to the by many thousands of million , the Confederation was six thousands of million of FRF by a provide Police , by the that in the bank .
whole Switzerland was affected , stated what dramatic that was this for a country small , if to banks so large .
Finally the sum the balance of the in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that the results economic of Switzerland ( see ) .
&apos; not we again to rescue to the &apos; , said , expert in .
the first disaster joined the second .
Few months after , the in a conflict tax with America and was ready to drawn the data of the customers wealthiest , that possibly had tax with aid the bank .
In , it a figure of were thousands of million of dollars , point of profits of these business with a There by payment .
With this , the more or least have helped in the fraud tax .
lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition by customers rich : the of discretion .
After the scandal , the secret the bank much already not is the same .
this continued the - the President of the junta directive and the President the board administrative .
And the led of the funds of the customers .
this way , in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central : in the of investments by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax .
And fair when back to be something more relaxed , fair when I that the back to this , is this history the with , a with individual 1.7 billion million of EUR , before of that the bank account of that something was is .
And , by what seen , this still not works well with the management of risk in the of investments .
&apos; With the case to that the controls of risk have changed too little &apos; , says Martin , a of economy and finance in the Institute of the University of .
The director financial of a great bank German also is sure : &apos; The problem of the is that not terms the controls of risk &apos; .
what that about the idea of the caution , with the that the bankers Swiss were since ago time , be the watch of the are goods the world : no risk too large , in change , the security the money to the another hand of the republic A .
The are of security of the banks Swiss were the symbol of the reliability , as and the chocolate genuine .
The central of the in not Exclusion with the buzz the much bank private much , only is a little greater .
The situation is classical .
The bank has their based main in the street of , that is since the station main directly the of , by the summits covered of snow of the mountains .
here the buildings are , the short are a of the more higher of Europe .
here are as between business traditional Swiss as the .
here appropriately since ago years the banks Swiss : since the bank national , and by the palace of , to the banks private as .
enter in the room of reception of the by a heavy door chair .
s the walls are of , front are large of such , with the logo the bank there a great for indicate the &apos; security &apos; .
The know what that the client search here : Security .
The two large banks Swiss , the and , in some time have the idea the great bank much , or the have betrayed , as view the President of a small bank private much .
they not read their name in the newspaper , the end and the out ago , as all the bankers Swiss , also with the business of both large banks .
The has fact too large , view , mainly in the of investments , where the exposed have cattle ground .
must the Swiss not had nothing more that say .
&apos; And have have for a time to the our of the exposed . &apos;
fact , the on the of investments with , concerned their first great great and then wine the disaster , no entity financial European had lost therefore money in the the high risk as the great bank much .
The 15 of October of 2008 , the disaster was clear .
&apos; That Wednesday the coalition government the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &apos; , it the author in their book &apos; Wever &apos; ( &apos; The of the &apos; in Spanish ) .
The political Kyrgyzstan to should thousands of million of FRF or approximately 45 thousands of million of EUR for save the great bank of the .
? How them is ?
about with the bankers Swiss , so are the problem in the dimension of the .
In June of 1998 , two of the three large banks Swiss in a consortium .
a bank that , because to the merger , was too large for the small Switzerland , and still growing .
what that was for that the two different banks types of the : a bank wealthy but asserts with the centre of the administration of goods in and a more poor but more strong .
suddenly , the banks of investment came of way well with a money , with the that could to a great bicycle financial .
There two names related with this increase of the : better , head the consortium of the of 2001 to 2007 , and , then President the board administrative .
&apos; always thought that and were a team perfect &apos; , says the expert in Hans .
&apos; , the intellectual , modest , that understand a of models and statistics , and , the that to showed step since the learning in the bank to the summit . &apos;
Finally , of .
And the end was probably a mistake decisive : &apos; that their models were a reality &apos; , says .
&apos; is a case tragic . &apos;
, perhaps .
is clear : The was before the case .
The employees of the remember clearly of the meetings of that , in the that , the head the consortium , always the same motto : the telling to let Sachs .
The bank American was the bank of investment more the world .
the &apos; &apos; , the that then the success of the banks .
The wanted be in the summit .
Some steps to within well .
In the operations of and in the negotiating of actions was in what more high .
, However , the From of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak : In the business the interest international , in the language of &apos; &apos; , there a There huge for the large banks .
The has in the products Americans .
For fill these , the started a adventure that almost to costs their existence .
of growth , therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investments American of high risk .
into in a machine powerful for appropriations Americans and to continuation , certain risks to account own .
And also , as other banks At the for a time .
&apos; In summer of 2007 , as the market real American was in , the there &apos; , said , expert in .
Only large the euphoria , so much the fall .
A asked had that go , already that the attempt of one s more complicated of what that registered .
The jobs in the became in seats and are to the currently .
currently , who at a great bank , has a work almost impossible .
must find a strategy for a bank , to the that all the models of business are around .
, expert in banks , has a idea , to end to the of investments , focus in the administration of goods , return to the roots .
The bank not to to so far ( still ) .
But the of investments must reduce a , is clear currently .
The next Thursday , , the new President the bank , will their future strategy the world .
In reality , only was in the of 51 years as a solution came , already that the bank the bank surprisingly of their predecessor .
project , he imposed : must to of way permanent the business of the , the bank of the Tuesday .
to restore the bank of investment to their state to the of the 1990s .
jobs .
But this not enough .
The needs a vision .
? Who is ?
? With what to win money ?
These are the questions that sure ago spoke currently .
far the time only says that first a housing with their woman in .
The next year .

line , the Congress prepared for to to a agreement on Libya
It that finally Republican and democrats in the are prepared to only of agreement on something related with the embargo in Libya .
All what that needed was that the Several had success , that the off dictator the Gaddafi outside Just and murdered and the participation of States United was to their end .
The Tuesday , the Committee of Affairs Foreign the Senate is to be a resolution , by the President John ( democrat by ) , with with the John ( by years ) and Father I. ( independent by ) , to the who by their successful Several and to the troops of US by their &apos; courage &apos; .
&apos; This resolution is for to the of Libya , the start to rebuild their country &apos; , said .
&apos; is a claim of support for their aspirations democratic . &apos;
The language can appear , but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy to now .
This summer , the legislators of both parties between itself and with the House White on the significant of a series of resolutions for approve or reject the role of the military of US in the mission of the NATO in Libya .
In June , and tabled a resolution that forming the use limited of forces military of US in Libya .
The project of law was in the House by a broader for , and that never was to in the Senate .
But the same day in that the project of law was rejected in the House , the chamber also rejected a measure that would the funds for the operations Americans in Libya .
helps with the mission of US in a kind of going legislative - with the Congress what enough people as for criticise the within by part of Obama of the mission , but not so as for in reality the under their feet .
continuation , the the Congress was by the events .
fell in hands of the rebels who in August , and Gaddafi was murdered the 20 of October .
The mission of the NATO end official the 31 of October .
now the Senate could be completed for act .
The resolution the Committee of Affairs Foreign &apos; welcomes the people of Libya by their courage and extraordinary resistance for explained to itself ourselves &apos; and &apos; endorses to the men and women of the of States United and to their partners of the coalition that took in operations military for protect the people of Libya by their extraordinary courage and professionalism &apos; .
The resolution also &apos; states the interest national of the States United in a successful and commitment transition towards the democracy in Libya . &apos;
? the new measure the completely support of the committee of Affairs Foreign , or to the legislators as was the project of law of June ?
The last version was rejected by the Senator Richard ( ) , the main the committee .
The spokesman of said the Monday that not had seen still the version end the new project of law .
At another hand the , the House is to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget it , a priority legislative for almost all the Republican and some democrats .
The measure , by the approaching ( by the ) , will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another issue that of fact a vote of all the assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress .
Other legislators not have had success to the time for to to their amendments to the assembly , but not by lack of see .
The of is only a of the should amendments constitutional that have not in this Congress , that a wider range of subjects .
Some are - the same project of law proposes therefore in the House as in the Senate - and other with small currencies between itself .
There by what least 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the House , and another handful that &apos; Control the expenditure federal . &apos;
Some of these projects of law also are between itself , but are to their - on all Republican rather that for their - the opportunity of of that them were the &apos; authors &apos; of this measure .
The Act of aspects of budget , that was The in August , that therefore the House as the Senate had a amendment the balance budgetary .
In March , Yet voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of that amendment .
than beyond the budget , several Member want limit the number of that the Member the Congress can to , while that the representative José E ( democrat by New York ) , to validity the limit of two for the chairmen .
The representative Jackson . ( democrat by Illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments that an the right to a education of quality and attention health , between other subjects .
A amendment that prohibits the marriage homosexual is a proposal , so as a that prohibits the burning of flags .
Some legislators also want allow the written-off of the laws federal if are been by two thirds of the states .
Only enthusiasts that have been the Member to the time of propose amendments , not are strings to a pace more quickly that in years previous .
In the Congress , the legislators Those 77 amendments , and tabled 66 in the .
The pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the the of 1990 , when the Member were regularly more of 150 amendments each two years , according figures by the the Senate .
But not had a more success then of what that what have now .
The last amendment that added - the 27 - was person in 1992 , but of fact was proposal by the Congress in .

A official military of high senior in the by , also known as the then President the State into EU-Turkey , the , was the role of the troops of way different .
&apos; The were as a kind of child &apos; , wrote the official in a e-mail an .
I sure of that the organizers they good intentions .

The issue is a issue very sensitive for the leaders military , that not want appear or in are with the public the that serve .

The walls have eyes : How the researchers you are at in Facebook
Before of become in the new face of the extreme right in Europe , Anders was simply another kind that their points of view in line .
The Monday , , who buried have done a killing in Norway in July , that with 77 dead , &apos; to their first hearing legal public .
While can have action only , was far of be only in the : There last the greater part the time that preceded to their attack with to their computer , with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in networks social .
After of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people .
But , ? how ?
- only you that into in Facebook .
&apos; We We account of that not was so difficult to to them &apos; , says , author main of a report published recently on the populism digital European by the centre of studies British .
The of information personal of Facebook is so , says , that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for The their characteristics with a precision scientific - the way that the sellers have state they for years .
The team of found a million of nowadays of the groups of right in all Europe and then them announcements , but in place of to a new on or product of , the announcements to the users to complete a survey that he on their level education , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future .
At to to through of Facebook , and their colleagues were able of to to more of 000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries European - all without out of the office .
&apos; is a way completely new of to a research &apos; , says .
Some of the results not are the all surprising : The supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young , men and by the immigration .
, However , in a kind of A , &apos; those that combined their in line with the outside of line are more reasonable , more democratic and least violent that those that are behind of the screen the computer &apos; .
The work of is only a example of how Facebook is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists .
of research , researchers medical and scientists political are they the website for to all , since problems of health to trends social such as &apos;s in the &apos; I like &apos; , messages in the walls and On of state .
With more of 800 million of users active a average of three parts of content the day , the &apos; of data &apos; of Facebook is and a on of the research , pushing the number of jobs academic with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years .
For some researchers , the beauty of Facebook is that you allows to to the people to the that not with a in the street .
&apos; Before , when to people the Party National British , was very difficult . &apos;
&apos; that go to through the party , and them never you bring the access &apos; , says .
&apos; Facebook see all that - you to them directly . &apos;
Other say that the website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of .
A study recent done by the , of the University of and their colleagues , found that the students It that they of their of in Facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that They in silence on the issue .
suggests that the colleagues of the students , such as the safeguard , could control the website and intervene for help to a student that it too On of state with their where .
&apos; not you treat a problem if not what you &apos; , said Dimitri , the of and director the Centre of Health , and Development the in the Institute of Research of Seattle , said the Washington Post .
&apos; We found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would . &apos;
Facebook also is constantly &apos; &apos; to their own population for obtain data .
The pull of Data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the Day of St Valentine , the either of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of National ( mainly they the information to the that can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago a time that people that the website should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research ) .
, However , the users of Facebook know that the website them is : , them like or not - the by power around the with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website your information personal .
But ? what is when the users of Facebook spend to be part of a survey that and even know ?
While that the researchers have guidelines well defined on how up their data outside of line , in line is a free for all .
&apos; not I that many of the users have thought even in the fact of that a , could be examining their profiles &apos; , says Voyager , a Empire the of of London , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of Facebook of students .
&apos; In what that to them thousand , was only between them and their friends . &apos;
Then is the question of the methodology .
Even outside of line , not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest .
In Facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the wall are truth .
&apos; What that in Facebook and what that as outside of Facebook are two things completely different &apos; , says .
is by that that , to despite of their years as , of the technology , believes that a and a are being the best tools of research that nobody can use .
&apos; not there substitute for into in the world real and about with the people real &apos; , says .
&apos; The research social is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line . &apos;
&apos; and inhuman : Anders ago their first emergence public in the court
Anders , the man that be the brain of the two attacks that were to 77 people in Norway this summer , has to to itself same as a of the &apos; resistance &apos; for their first emergence public in the court of Oslo .
&apos; I a commander military in the movement of resistance Norwegian and in the From of Norway &apos; , said to a room full with 500 people .
&apos; I am the court , already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology the hatred and because supports the . &apos;
&apos; I the facts but not I guilty . &apos;
The judge was to for that , because &apos; not wanted to to the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that their points of view &apos; .
the same reason refused to allow to , that by a speech writing with Reports , House to the family of their victims the end of the hearing .
also Prosecutor to the police keep to under custody for 12 weeks more , to banned the access to the means of communication for four weeks , and said that the authorities should that have a be control on all the visits and the for eight weeks .
manufacturing of 30 survivors and family of the victims laws to the hearing .
Some as with the hope of look to to the eyes , other for confirm that is under key .
all laws with the aim of move towards the conclusion .
&apos; I that seemed cold and inhuman &apos; , said a of to the outlet .
&apos; was oust , but for me was a step on after of see and hear the suspect . &apos;
with a suit dark and can blue , remained and professional to what long of the hearing and to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when on and went the building .
despite of the strange notion of of be part of a movement of &apos; resistance &apos; greater , the judge that not is a ill mental , and said that not there evidence of that act with .
is possible that to some them that the attacks the 22 of July makes be labour of a in place of a group of radical .
But that not automatically the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feel .
&apos; I like that into a monster , but not what seems &apos; , said a family of a victim .
&apos; would a more easy if what into . &apos;
7 of the interview up of , show in a theatre this week
After the death of , the 5 of October , was some that what with Ford - the out of the technology as the Great .
But what that the nowadays of could find more intend , in a interview to recently to the that has as deprived of a series of special in the are markets this week , is how about this mind about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products .
was without doubt a leather , and , but also was a whoever and a of the of flow - a man that that many place &apos; a disease that is in think that a great idea is the 90 by % the work ... &apos; but &apos; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product . &apos;
In 1995 , approaching was developing the series of television The of the ( The of the ) on the the computer personal , and laid for more of a time with for a can and rarely conversation .
In that time had last old 10 years since that had been forced to leave of , and already working turn in their new company is , waiting the adoption popular of Internet .
While that a small part of the interview of used in , said that the original of the interview existing for their transport .
was only after of the death of that was a copy full in in the garage the director .
This material of we , slightly , is the basis of : The interview up , of should minutes , that is to the this Wednesday and Thursday .
For someone known by the interviews in depth , here seems surprisingly prepared to forward their how and strategies trade .
And very .
In four points different to what long of the interview , there large between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of , where is clearly their thoughts , for precision .
also there at in the that the of its to the surface , where seems because to the questions of , to go more quickly towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance .
before of the was of , the or the , there something in The interview up , when what that is that other companies do well and is , and does their own vision the future of the is .
A thing is read assessments of the career of , but there something oil and in the that see here , the the on of the provide .
He has a vision of as can and must be the things .
not a after of all with detail here , was and what was .
A quickly short of seven in of The interview up :
On how to to a business :
&apos; what long of the years in the business , I always he : &apos; &apos; ? what as things ? &apos; and the answers that you are of way are : &apos; Oh , that is only the way as ago &apos; .
Nobody know by what ago what that ago , in the business nobody of in the things very deeply .
That is what that I .
has the detail their efforts for simplify the accounting of .
by the way in the costs - to often beginning with a &apos; cost standard &apos; that was to eye of good , and that then line with a &apos; one &apos; - developed a factory that that could The the costs trade the detail .
On the joke the Pope :
the &apos; Members Blue &apos; that he same was with - a has that up to the people effectively the company telephone and to so-called to long distance free .
has writing widely about the has , but the euphoria of here the under the Members Blue as a act of is .
how he and the box by the use of a telephone public , doing a so-called , and then since a network of to other , while a with the greater amount of satellite possible .
&apos; right the things around the world a average dozen of sometimes and to through the telephone public and back a minute more later the telephone public of the door of the hand &apos; , says with a .
&apos; distinguished young and what that was that stage build something us ourselves that could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world . &apos;
We two , not together a , but stage build a thing small that could control a thing heralded - was a lesson incredible , and not I that never would said without it .
continues a joke that he and almost kept , the Actually to through of the Members Blue in half of the night and through about with the Pope , while was their better imitation of asked .
measure that several Member of the hierarchy Catholic were in half of the night for about with the diplomatic US , the two in fair before of that the Pope outside foul for go to answer the telephone .
On of the technology ( and the sale by telephone with garage ) :
the age of 12 years , to the hunting of parts of spare for build a of often , At to garage in the guide telephone and to was a so-called .
Little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes , to a employment of summer to time - in initiated .
&apos; That was a remarkable influence on me , was the only company that had seen to that age and formed my vision of what that was a company and what well that to their employees . &apos;
became after in one of the employees of that They the laboratories of research of the company in High , where was &apos; the first computer of table never fact &apos; .
was so large as a Then , had a small screen of , and I of he .
a journey to as 41-year-old and the time with that machine and programmes for it .
On the innovation :
In several points of the interview , about about of reinvent new products on the into .
approaching in their career , already that he to sell a handful of Le basis , to asked a client if could they all the team .
with only 30 days of credit , had that told the and the over of the equipment .
than later , while was in , reminds the struggles to the that &apos; in the development of a of computer :
&apos; I agreement of have arguments dramatic ... I that and five years &apos; for create a that 300 dollars &apos; , and I and I I outside and I a leather .
days after , had a that stage build by 15 dollars and that was completely reliable .
On the large companies losing force :
before of that the in of , foresaw the way in that many leaders of the industry in their vision , and the control of their share of market .
&apos; privileges that in or , by what that as and best , ? and what ? &apos;
You has the monopoly of the share of market , by what that the company not has more success .
The departments of sales and marketing increase the success , by what that are this class of people the that end by to the companies and the people peacekeepers of the products are the forum for the decision-making of decisions .
The out of the products that was to that position of monopoly by fault of people that not have the notion of good products one products - the knowledge the profession necessary .
That is what that happened in ...
could have of all the industry is .
could have been ten sometimes their size , could have been the Microsoft of the years 90 ...
the defeat of the victory .
On the innovation as expression artistic :
&apos; There a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... to measure that the great idea , is and overall . &apos;
you a about of the of the same .
There people that you that to - some things that not you to that do the , the glass the ago , the the do , the factories the do .
she that keep together things in your brain - these concepts - all to the time ...
At end all reduces the will - forcing to try to what better that a team of human has fact , and then treat of which these things to the that your with doing .
artistic said that the good artists fast , the large artists .

As detect a lie
A market to the headlines more recent us points divide serious and curse are the deception and the lie in the life daily .
The candidate presidential is occupied accusations of harassment sexual with several women ; each part accused of Union to the other .
The administrators of the University State of Pennsylvania have been accused of by supposed conceal reports that were that a you of football withdrawn was sexually to children .
The week last , the President French , Claus Sarkozy , was &apos; &apos; with a turned open saying the President of US , Barack Obama , that the first minister Israeli course Netanyahu is a do .
has destroyed to and countries .
The by New York and in Internet , , was the ourselves with their quickly by the test .
The former candidate presidential John has been accused of take in the funding of the campaign to with the of a relationship .
And , of new , nobody that what never the circus up by the President garage Clinton the Union for their Secondly mandate about of their relationship sexual with .
are very the myths on the traps in the with of the school and the university .
have given cases in the that the teachers have given the answers of the with to the students with the end of be better seen in their assessments of performance .
that should be what contrary are sending the message of that Union and is are tonnage .
? How deception us are ?
In a day who , the studies show that you can Union in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes .
That sure , many of these lies are lies .
Another study was that the issue three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of .
lies , or &apos; the which of lies &apos; , is a as essential that we acquire all , by reasons therefore personal as professionals .
times of be a at of table similar to , by example , , where the aim is : &apos; didn I &apos; , the detection the deception is a an the knowledge serious on in data scientists and for the last six decades in universities that held projects of research in depth , especially in and .
One of the results of the research is that the old about of the lie have been .
The itself who to the eyes .
not always , , or .
not can conclude not that the are difficult of detect or unmasked .
A of lies trained can to to the truth to about of the structure of the statement , the , the training of questions and the times .
had several years the scientists on the deception in the currently and always he body the knowledge , and was clear that the detection the deception is a technical modern that is easy of learn and aid to foe by our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations .
The good have the as of read well to the others , legitimate in to will , their own emotion and of way how the were the others .
We by the research that the more that the , that the men say more &apos; lies win towards itself ourselves &apos; , while that the women say more lies &apos; win towards the others &apos; normally for protect the feelings of someone that the people married least to their partners that the people that not are married ( but the lies that usually say tend to be &apos; enormous &apos; ) .
also know that if you is observations as a , the others least guilty the .
? How know if someone is ?
First , US the for her the such .
This is &apos; create a line of basis &apos; .
Aid to provide points of reference for measure after the changes .
the position the such , and feature showed .
is better that will if someone normally with the ordinary all the time for not to accusations as when to see the feet in half of the meeting .
continuation , groups of behaviour sell , and not .
to these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm , not as test of deception .
The people that con can freeze the part higher the body the treat of remember their history , can where their feet towards the door , towards a exit , change their position of way significantly or a &apos; &apos; that slightly of and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have over .
often the do see that the interview has over only for to that .
also centuries attention the vocabulary the such .
Ayr the to the fund and the time last while awaiting that their wife murdered was , a for of it to level national .
The people that con also can use a language : &apos; not I relations sexual with that woman ... the &apos; or repeat a question difficult accomplished .
The indicators more common are .
. can use a lot of &apos; language been &apos; when says to a question difficult : &apos; Well ... to say truth ... to what that I ... to my understand . &apos;
This ago that the answer be a in place of a fact and is to often a signal of and .
not there no formula for detect lies , but develop skills for it the deception is possible .
These skills will the for of who for avoid be by the artists of the mischief in their lives professionals and personal .

is interesting because I that there a couple of songs in the new sites that such time makes more , but also there songs , as The or that as as songs very aspects but can sounding a little Positive .
With both , when I the , when the to and are songs deeply aspects .
I that when and there some in your life and lose to a family or a friend , these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs , without doubt , for that for me .

? or mountain ?
The architects line in the opportunity of the call more beyond of controversial on being
The tender municipal on the 16 doors the debate on the role of in Barcelona
of the 80 , in full for of the already of Barcelona ( ) , this Administration a of promotion of .
The the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona city .
is more , of a compared , in figures , with the Central .
With the death of the , in turned , the park the to , in the , of many , as the limit higher of Barcelona , being the capital of the few that not in the which east but down ( mountain ) ( sea ) .
The opinion of as park natural &apos; in this idea .
The reference already not was Central but , with the in the role the .
In these was to that , in September , the Council a states by 16 senior for other many doors of access to .
A door routes to the idea of park , without doubt .
Or that or someone is to doors the field .
The question its single : , ? park or mountain ?
The tender , therefore by their it merely as by what that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects .
is almost already a issue recurrent the that it hand when two Member of this former form of elected recognise in a lift .
And this fact of ordinary , exactly , to a of the few between what that people three architects , and teachers It , that have presented .
Miguel , Daniel and : the tender is right .
For , after they the with along &apos; ago necessary &apos; discuss on &apos; the with of mountain &apos; , all time that the speech of , the of the peaches devote , not has taken to out .
&apos; , from of the basis of that the park more Wild of Barcelona is the a .
Among other things by their great .
is more complex &apos; , ruling the architect for who the title of &apos; doors of &apos; within a &apos; trap &apos; : not there that think in them &apos; as the to a park , but the of a areas where there that act &apos; .
, as and with experience in the world , described the proposal of &apos; challenge intellectual &apos; with &apos; some dangers &apos; .
derivatives of what &apos; uncertain that is today day project the space public &apos; after the experience in the 80 and that had in the area the &apos; their keeping the &apos; .
The first fear is the own of a borders on where can build .
&apos; baby something is them already the next step &apos; , is say , their .
&apos; There that think in new instruments , of planning , because the current &apos; in reference the Plan General ( ) &apos; can to ordinary to disasters &apos; .
than to the question , view that , , the it of &apos; can regard as a park , the of Barcelona , not &apos; , by a question merely .
reminds that already is a work fact by the of that &apos; not must fall in together it &apos; , but thanks the opportunity that the Council does to their of intervene in this project &apos; since the first time &apos; .
And still more , understand that the of the mountain with the city is the I that allows to the architects into in the debate , but &apos; doubt &apos; on if is this profile technical the that must lead the equipment ( &apos; all a likewise &apos; , as ) that have had that create : &apos; The architects should be only a tool &apos; .
nothing that the answer to the question that of title to this one is complex , because in the foundations the tender lack a vision global of : &apos; have much 16 senior missing in the sense , but not is a reading , that see and understands the area in their whole &apos; .
This from , the least in their case , that has choice by participate in the 16 senior .
another way , a project for a of the doors can in programme and definition with the the architect of the door of the hand .
In their opinion , that itself , the Council should ensure that the Strip immediately higher to the Round of should could , in all their spread , a area of that a anymore transition between the city and what green .

Then of days of , the a legal the Network the forgiveness the brother the Mayor of the process that to was by
Then of remain days denied , Manuel come in freedom then of that the a legal the Network to the forgiveness to the The Criminal of democratic , that still a process by blackmail against the brother the Mayor of .

This Monday , the a legal of Network , Emmanuele Garcia , turned to the José to for the forgiveness for the brother the Mayor ; by what that in the next hours could to their freedom .
During the legal , the or the Ministry the , - , to Garcia if had repaired the damage and who of the partners of the home of betting was the that the forgiveness , but the lawyer tried Budget the name .
With basis the dossier Spanish / 2011 this the forgiveness legal to and in what not will stand complaint any in about the process that to was ; also of that not to of damage and punishment .

The secretary publishing of details the accident air where lost the life the secretary of , Franz , and seven people more
The of communications and Transport ( ) , that the results form on the accident where lost the life the secretary of , Franz , and seven people more , show that the grant of way direct on the ground in full integrity structural , without that the pilot could try a landing enforced .
During a conference of press , publishing , secretary of communications and Transport , mentioned that before of take the , the pilot drop that the conditions of climate were the right for there .
&apos; The elements that seem indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the &apos; .
also , that the unit was sewn for 19 people , by what that had with the necessary for carry the personal .
In , said that in the research made in the area the impact not the emergence of parts in the ground .
&apos; In a for our that not there parts or security of the in another place , the impact presented of way structural .
&apos; The design the grant was for 19 passengers , had with adequate for to the passengers .
The ground is a outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of Then .
the time , the secretary was that is a priority have with the results before possible ; without However , the research can last several months , even could achieve a year .
their part , oxide Shaw , director general of and , was that the time the impact , the grant the State into in speed of cruise and that this happened in a ground harmonised .
&apos; This information strengthens the of a operation normal of cruise the time the impact &apos; , expressed .
In the conference of press , the want of the , publishing , six element relevant in the research :
about :
accordance to the aeronautics the flight was under the rules of flight about , this means that the must have visibility for the flight and the ground .
likely :
The in the conditions right the from , with is the towards the area bordering between the and the State of Mexico were ground of to low at .
:
is likely that by the conditions of the has a area of will course and greater visibility towards the valley of .
the impact .
The of impact and the last registration of the the radar line , probably before the impact not was loss of control and at in the very of flight .
of remains of the in a area reduced :
The information available to the time it mean that the impact happened in a very straight and of hand .
The of of remains of the it mean that the grant in the ground in conditions of integrity structural .
not has been fact of ceasefire or explosion :
In the website the are are without in the remains of the of some kind of explosion or ceasefire .
The last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground .
During the jobs of field have found parts of the to a course of 9 billion 200 feet on the level a the sea , the ground is a outstanding that is since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of Then .
The photographs show the sequence in the that expected to what long of said way .
The information means elements that seem indicate that the grant could have had multiple in the ground .
After of the for It in a area more wider that the website , around the accident , not have found parts pieces of the , what that strengthens the presumption of that the impact presented in conditions of integrity structural .
is protocol for found gene of obesity
the will security a research for it the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in specialists the
The Institute participate the will security ( ) announced that at a research for it the gene of the obesity in children and young , so-called protocol &apos; of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , that will have with with the obesity .
In a release , the head of the Unit of Research in the St of the Centre National 21st , Miguel Cross oxide , he that by a team of medical , nurses , and workers social .
In team is supported by specialists and a of the Institute National of Health Public ( ) and the Centre of Research and of approximately ( ) the Institute National ( ) .
In the research being to participate to the population be or not , come to the units sporting participants the in the Valle of Mexico , where are to out the evidence to the under , all the I to from of the 8 : a.m. hours .
that the protocol started in the Unit ( State of Mexico ) and that since the 8 of October , the activity has to out in the Unit ( State of Mexico East ) .
A time that a the aim of together to 500 or 600 under , the study continue in the Unit Independence ( southern the democratic Federal ) and finally in the Unit ( the north the democratic Federal ) .
that the purpose of this research is of the security and the importance of the genetic with on the development of the obesity and identify in children and young interest factors of risk for prevent the emergence of diseases chronic .
At have this 14 of November the Day World of the , that the aim is together to three billion children and young between six and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , for the implementation of specific on food .
also them on the activity physical and background of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that as disease or recurrent .
that the I them applies to all the participants measurements ( weight , enormous , circumference of ) , decision-making of pressure pressure , determination of the levels of , , and insulin and beings ( search identify genes that to the obesity child ) .
Cross oxide pointed that this research of to the concern of the professionals of the health by the alarming increase of weight in the under .
&apos; The out of health of 1999 and 2006 open that in so only six years was a increase , in the case of the children , of 77 by % in obesity , and of the girls of 47 by % ; in terms of obesity also observed a , dramatic &apos; , skills the specialist the .
that the justification for the for of the in that the population the country from of other by their history genetic .
informed that in average , the Mexican has 65 by % of inheritance subject American , 30 by % European and five by % wage and this condition reflects in the genes that take to disease and too of weight .
that of way general , the genetic of the obesity mean in the inability of baby the too of energy that ( had ) and that hold in way of are .
The , he that the benefit direct for the participants is the assessment contained of the children , what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity .
Even , said , the presence of of colour ( ) in bottleneck and , that show the likelihood of that and to .
The information &apos; of way confidential , the medical the by writing to the parents , to who them is each a of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life that must to for prevent diseases .
Cross oxide he that there three security main that cause obesity , obesity and other : the , that is the lack of activity physical daily , remain the greater part the day at with the television and use means of transport in place of walking travel used .
also must to the high , is say , the greater consumption of excess , of ( , bread , , clones , etc ) with high content in made and with and the genetic that analysing in this protocol .
of the bumpy
Raphael , , of the had of of the , develops which with for produce a a with better every , regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature
If the signals that are the like - , not would necessary close of 200 billion bumpy each season of dry in the the Valle of Mexico , emergency Raphael , , of the had of ( ) of the , who was that if the process of construction and it of a is the for , the bumpy could radioactivity in amount or , even , service by completely .
In their conference A opinion technological of the bumpy , in the framework the Year International of the , was to of that the laboratory to their office develops which with for produce a a with characteristics like to the the she , but with a greater resistance mechanics , therefore to highest as to in temperatures .
that this kind of which could used in places where the climate is extremely a , as some cities the north the country , for improve their every and , by what therefore , the training of bumpy .
that the she , the part more heavy the oil , is a whole of of , a of high weight , so-called , and other of under weight , so-called , that EMIs to are the their characteristic behaviour .
The behaviour the she is in that to highest temperatures , close of the U-turn degrees , means as a tanks , to 120 degrees degree their is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost much , while that to temperatures very in , the she again , added .
What previous means that in the streets the resistance the she not is uniform , but that is constitutes for the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature , emergency the specialist in engineering chemistry .
The , of the observed that the streets of the City of Mexico in their majority are covered by flexible , the which consists of six ground of materials , of the which the last three the she .
Among the ground more is the , by small stones in she and then .
Every a of the that is the , pointed , is with she .
At the vehicles and efforts , this allows that the forces are very well in the .
If like of she amended still better , time the an chemical .
On the , , put a last as so-called of , the which is nation of a material of stone fine , is say , a bit that also in she .
As is of the as that is to be in contact with the of the vehicles , must have more force mechanics that the and provide in the way .
At be the part the that is to receive and thing the efforts , the of required , also , have the thick for and must they the material the that is nation .
The climate , especially the They and the currencies of temperature , also are a factor very important to be , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the every of the .
When the ground , the water way in the internal of the and is difficult that from , this results a of all the ground the and , by what therefore , the training of bumpy .
In the process of training of a , said , the first in is the film of and only after affects the , but the damage not is , but that is a process that should to the first signals with adequate programmes of it .
The also Member the Human National of he that the burden is another factor important in the training of bumpy and , by this , the thick of each a of the ground the must go always in relationship with the burden and ensure that a , for avoid that question bumpy .
Raphael emergency that still there a that with and work on the she , by example , the , that in other countries already are even in the market and it the bumpy with easily and without need of use highest temperatures .
? What to knowingly to the Cresson the Valle for be the new Colombia ?
of the factors that for that not the crown of Colombia .
The Valle In their title number 14 of similarly .
new the Valle the is with the to of the crown of Colombia .
This time had that shaping with be in the of , the crown of silver and the on that the as new similarly of Colombia .
With the result obtained in , where the Atlantic with the crown and the , the department already sum 14 titles of here and a to the of women that have state close of the crown but that were between them of ( Dalmatian ) , ( ) , from ( 1979 ) , was Valentino ( 1981 ) , Mary ( 1983 ) , María ( turned ) , ( 1988 ) , ( 1989 ) , María ( 1990 ) , ( 1993 ) , ( 2000 ) , ( 2007 ) , ( 2008 ) .
Today the great question that many do is ? What knowingly ?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great that in each presentation proved that it had all for be the new Colombia , not in vain was is of the Police and better of , titles that to as or who were the crown of Colombia .
The first factor that as key in the decision that took the jury of First here long-term in that not with their answer to the question &apos; ? What is that book that you has there to you and by what ? nation by , of the .
At the asked :
&apos; shall a , I quite in the literature , I that is a way of , definitively I that the book that I espoused of childhood is &apos; The &apos; , is a book quite discontentment .
currently &apos; and punishment &apos; , is a book of literature universal that all we read ; and today in day I found the book of , a Russian , a book that is &apos; The of the blood &apos; &apos; .
A answer that little was first by the term &apos; &apos; and Secondly by not explain of way particular of what way each one of the books that the have there .
But the conclude the ceremony itself your relaxed and happy with the result &apos; the universe is is what that has that to .
And for all the people , by favour Please a , &apos; The &apos; is a great book &apos;
Among the whole says that to Valle the the .
A journalist that the be the theories , the and the Cresson that was all the awarding hypothetical ( challenge of , vote the public by the better suit notions , and troubled ) , &apos; that up the of the other has , to the and and by that not in the stage &apos; .
And that in their first presentation in suit of bathing in the a the and their two in the evening of .
Although in both safe , that to missing the force and the impetus that the representatives of and Atlantic itself showed .
Ariel , journalist the programme &apos; As in home &apos; , the things time that the fact of that outside or similarly &apos; than that the Cresson that more awarding earns for the tender not is as and &apos; .
In , Valle was to what last very with the press , and there .
The is that Valle not in persuade the jury on their interest towards the work social , that is in last , the essence the National of .
something , two days before of the election the jury international itself that them a woman with the needs social of their .
&apos; The beauty single not enough in a Colombia , there that look region beyond of what physical and on in their sensitivity social , that before of imply the are already in projects &apos; , he .
also that Valle by their flaws in the and the that to in their , but is hold therefore precisely the jury the was as the Cresson &apos; natural &apos; with the body more healthy , good food and work physical responsible .
The of Borg recognised that not had the better body , that had best , &apos; but their problem of in the , that the truth for my not was very , to They points in the last day &apos; .
Among therefore the journalist came , of the magazine as that the mistake of the were the speeches that .
&apos; The are well , but Valle not the it to .
body never was their strong and here the &apos; .
this was , that by first time over the National of the , after the raised in suit of bathing about a that whole , therefore said that this was the that to to for not you the will of the crown .
or not , what true is that since today at a year of , not as sovereign , but as similarly , position that to offered the possibility of represent to Colombia in one of the international by designation the own National .
, However , it will to the history as a of the that to despite of their step by , to was the crown .
So was the work the that lighthouse the of
A of happened to the history as the man that this the death of &apos; &apos; .
The work of these officials is key .
The last 4 of November a the of happened to the history as the man that this the identity the maximum head of the : &apos; &apos; , to through the of their fingerprinting digital .
the seven that in the the , that week to the time of &apos; availability &apos; to González , a man of Puerto that has 21 years working in the area of research legal .
At an their career , González worked in municipalities the , where many sometimes had that by more of five days in the jungle for to the website in the that were the bodies that be be at .
In the 2000 found to the capital the Valle and , then of to the for appropriate , in , that is the study of the fur of , is say , of the of the hands and of the feet .
The week the operational against to to these that set clothes minimum for three days .
One large to than .
The Friday in the night went for the in a grant since .
that should identify two bodies and that that one of them was the man that Schuman to the more former the world , by what that to ’ that set the card of currently de ( their real name ) .
, However , when was with the team of research the website in the that was the not what by by their aspect physical , therefore was very different the that had seen in the means of communication .
was without , clothing as a fresh of the area , without glasses and a more slip .
But the fingerprinting not .
of a , ink , a and a , the from fingerprints the with the of the card .
eye not to : was &apos; &apos; .
That same night , the man of Puerto was the The of the minister of Defence , John Charles , that itself was the maximum head of the .
In for of the left
For a of the of the recognition that was the President John Manuel one to González , in the wheel of press by the operational against &apos; &apos; , is very significant .
Many people not known our work .
The is a science accurate , without for of mistake , that can to to be key in the resolution of crimes .
Apart of the identification of bodies , the support research by crimes as and murder and opinion the identity of the people .
When arrested , many criminals have wishful or not have in .
We them we the impression and the look in the basis of data .
The , MPs that , in a case of , to validity a , of wall of a home , therefore in that place the do had supported their hand for from a box strong full of and money .
&apos; The walls are difficult because not are land for from a impression , but in that case we obtain the left of all the hand and identify the criminal , that had participated in different &apos; , reminded .
The fingerprinting also can take or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder .
ago little found to a man died , with cabin of to their around .
a of the research that a family could be suspect the crime and , effectively , a left in the bottleneck .
Although this not an that has been the murderer , itself what in the scene the crime .
A the he that in the items &apos; the fingerprinting with chemical or physical &apos; .
When with , used a or tape for .
Then of this , the from are settlement to the , that is the basis of data , or to the .
&apos; The problem is that still there many Columbians do &apos; , Members the expert the .
that not all is as shows in the programme of television .
So as not all what that which is gold , not all what that is again left .
, However , if can be , if for the dynamic .
The &apos; &apos; nations to authorities in New York
of demonstrators intimidatory to the place for .
A great part the order of and found to a have .
The those the movement Wall Street this Tuesday to the authorities of New York the treat of into of new , under the under of a order legal , to the place of Manhattan of where were of had and the treat of should another park of the Great .
of demonstrators intimidatory to the place , where wanted access thanks to a order legal that allows to the &apos; &apos; again to in the place , while that other part the movement asked the may a park more the north of the city , where has there new arrests .
&apos; Our idea is that , if the court not us allows again to in the place , us we to on in some another place and the battle legal by again to , so as to through of around and demonstrations peaceful &apos; , said one of the for the movement &apos; Wall Street &apos; , Mark .
that the answer of the &apos; &apos; the of their camp partly personally by the Mayor of New York , building , was to the courts , where the issued a order that the evacuation the place and up to the demonstrators to is .
In , the &apos; &apos; to the occupation of a new park which in the of the things Street and the , very close of the entry the tunnel , that unite New York and New Jersey , and property of the used of .
At least for a time council should the place , but after the Police turned and 17,900 to stop to some of the demonstrators , but not could confirm the figure concrete , while was to that was to several journalists that were also .
The organisation will that are several hundreds of people the that had installed in that point , where already has a delegation of leaders religious in shows of support to the those the movement and that has treaty of with the Police .
Among therefore , the place - is a of property still closed to the expected of the it of a view legal measures for this same Tuesday in the that must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this had .
Some of the demonstrators IDPs to there and to these hours millions of that order legal and even the to the players that the place , what that resulted &apos; some small clashes &apos; , Members , who Jewish that some official coups to the demonstrators .

The Mayor Members to the press that , because to that order legal , the city had suspended the the space the public and to the demonstrators , to the that Our , without However , that the laws local not them it their to on with shops of campaign and medication of our .
The URBAN personally the taken to out of had of the place , a operation in the that 17,900 to around of 200 arrests and that decided because the demonstrators were &apos; violations the law &apos; .
he that was the order of the place because this was becoming &apos; in a place in the that the people not to protest , but to all the laws and , in some cases , to to damage to other people &apos; , already that &apos; some business received threats &apos; and the neighbours &apos; by their quality of life &apos; .

Japan after the earthquake
The GDP overall a 1.5 % thanks the consumption successful and being end to the spiral of that set in March
Since the last month of March the economy macroeconomic was paralysed , still by the devastating earthquake that in a crisis nuclear , the worst disaster that the country since the II War World .
The first estimates the Government of the losses materials in 300 million of dollars , a coup that , despite the difficult context world , seems have .
After of three quarters of , the fact the Interior between July and September was for to Indeed , definitively : the GDP a 1.5 % in compared with the quarter previous and a 6 % in rate .
The reported in the Secondly quarter - for the Japanese , the year tax beginning in March of 2012 - is , also , the greater pace of growth since the period of January to March of 2010 .
The recovery is , in part , by the of the buying of machinery for restored the areas by the and the and tsunami .
fact , the companies by their investments in a 1.1 % , with the declining the % in expenses of capital that observed of January to March , the first the after of six months of such .
, However , the real of the economy macroeconomic not on exclusively in the momentum - that being to take the crisis for strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure , of the shortcomings for grow since zero .
Japan has foul , on all , thanks to the development the consumption successful , that in the currently represents the 60 % the GDP .
This one a 1 % , by the increase the expenditure in vehicles , travel and activities of leisure .
The stigma the
has the market internal , when the - the currency - has become in one of the &apos; values refuge &apos; by the investors that being of the crisis of debt in the area euro and the flows forecasts of US , a privileged that is as a in the accounts of the companies .
With a home more strong , the products are more expensive in the abroad , a seriously reverse for a country whose line of economic next certain by the health of the large groups aimed .
recalled or , by example , their weak results between July and September to the share the .
While the markets are with their to the countries troubled of the EU , the Government of not low the on-call .
&apos; There that be stress to the risks that massive , as the deterioration of some economies foreign , the impact of the floods of Thailand and the fast so the &apos; , pointed yesterday the secretary of State of Policy economic , .
And , in effect , the prospects not are encouraging .
The Organisation for the Cooperation and the Development Economic ( OECD ) that the majority of the countries Member tabled in September signs more of realm economic .
The indicator that the points of turning in the economy world it of highlighted that the main powers are .
already that They four to the points , with to the of August .
The area euro , even , by below of the average , that is in the level 100 , the eight to the points .
Athens again to which the doubt
says that the adjustments , but the Conservatives not no compromise writing

The receiving proposes choose the President European by suffrage universal
The first day the conference of the Union ( receiving ) , the Monday 14 of November , in also , has so without large difficulties for Angela Angela , Chancellor and President the party .
Initially not had including in the order the day the future of Europe , but the issue imposed in autumn , in particular for satisfy to the fighters that they that the policy the Government is currently too little strict with the Greeks and could become in a future with the Italian .
The motion on the Presidency of the Commission European , proposal by the direction , adopted virtually by unanimity .
the naturally , so only connection nine votes in against and ten .
The of several minutes that , with their speeches , Angela Angela and , after several hours , , the Minister of saw , any doubt possible .
The idea key of the Chancellor , and of the motion , short in a motto : the answer to the crisis &apos; not is least Europe , but more Europe &apos; .
not only because Europe is the peace , but also because &apos; nine million of jobs on directly the euro &apos; .
For the Chancellor , &apos; has come the time of open way in Europe &apos; .
This could practically in amendments the Treaty of Lisbon for allow strengthen the control of the Union European on the policies budget of the countries of the area the euro , but also could in the election the President of the Commission European by suffrage universal for &apos; you a face to Europe &apos; .
In all case , that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress , clearly idea of .
, doubt , is little likely that the bringing are quickly to a agreement on this change radical : Great Britain shows hostile to he and the leaders of the receiving seem know that Sarkozy also .
But the providing is on the ground .
another hand , the naturally have rejected by a majority result the proposal of the weight of each country of the directive the Bank Central European in role the weight of each economy , what which obviously the weight of Germany .
by the encouraged in the internal of their party , the Chancellor has increased the we to Konrad and . But not is that has tried who to their conference to at of the &apos; small &apos; countries European or of the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the he Germany .
Although the motion on Europe he a paragraph to the importance of &apos; the time &apos; , Angela Angela not has to France .
of last .
s that , ago two centuries , in a bloody battle in also .
fact , was a of the more humiliating for the army of Rostopchine .
The impact the fraud in the in by disease
After the benefits , the and the Government a for against the in by disease .
Sarkozy will the Tuesday 15 of November in Bordeaux for visit a box responsible of the benefits family and pronounce a speech on the issue , already recurrent since 2007 , of the fight against the fraud social and the .
In , for - such for , that part of the will of save of way average , but still so reminds to a which of the campaign presidential of right , the majority to on in the in by disease .
In first place , for apply cuts budgetary : the Government for impose to the workers the sector private a quarter day of we before of power take the low .
In final , unless that there a convention of company specific , a worker that ill four days of wage , is say , a minimum the 15 % of their income month .
is of a measure that could on a wave of , but that would save million of EUR , according them .
In , would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic : impose to the officials a day of we without remains in case of low labour ( to the time , not have we , with to the three days that apply in the sector private ) .
While these issues , the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud , this time looking towards the abuses of the in labour .
&apos; Van to significantly the controls and , also , if which to someone planned a fraud , must the &apos; , emergency about in the the Sunday 13 of November .
At as that in the other cases , the effects the announcement seem slightly for the reality the fraud in on of in labour .
fact , since 2002 for a monitoring constant of this question and have it various they policies that , normally , have given emerged .
The French not more that in the rest of Europe .
at with attention , in first place , the figures national .
According the Institute French of the security social ( ) , in 2006 more of million of EUR in particular by in labour .
According the Institute French of research and background in economy of the health , the benefits by the in , in 2008 , the 5 % the expenditure health , to million of EUR .
this sum , the 46 % is to the in by leave and by accidents labour , while that the 54 % is related with the in by disease , figure that out to million of EUR .
therefore , the 2.5 % the expenditure in health .
In 2010 , the French have a average of days of low labour , with to in 2009 , according a study the group .
A average that , without doubt , behind government : other survey , published in 2007 by the Syrian of management professional , that the 75 % of the workers French prevent that not had and a only day of low by disease .
Another study , in this case of the , points that in 2010 the 37 % of the in by disease had a long-term from to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more extended .
If the compared with our neighbours European , the workers French not are more that in other areas to take in by disease .
A long study done in 2010 by two researchers the top that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of lack global the work ( therefore by reasons of health as of another kind ) , in France , between the 10 % and the 11 % , with to a 20 % and a 28 % in Denmark , a 15 % in United UK or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the Netherlands Netherlands .
The fraud in the in by disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not of .
The fraud has a reach quite limited .
The forward of the legislation , since 2002 , has caused that the controls of the in by disease of more of 45 days are .
In 2008 , of 1.5 million of inspections , the , in a 13 % of the by , that the in of shorter long-term were &apos; unacceptable or too are &apos; , is say , cases .
In the case of the in of more of 45 days , untreated to inspections , was that the 11 % of the cases were &apos; rightly or ; a figure that , taking as starting a total of 1.2 million , out to .
therefore , high a total of cases &apos; &apos; between several million of workers that a low by disease .
, doubt , a figure If in compared , by example , with the work in black .
According the Member of the , author of a report on this question in June , this practice will a losses of income tax of between and 15 million of EUR the year , is say , more that the cost total of the benefits by in and , without doubt , significantly more that the fraud in this last area .

The risk of infection of the crisis of the debt still to the We European .
despite the Members of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy , so as of a best figures of growth in France and Germany , the types of the countries more are increasing .

Germany , by their part , has reported a growth the 0.5 % in the same period .
out the first forecasts for the whole of the area the euro to the 11 hours , after of that the Commission European has came on the risk of a new recession .
Policy energy :
the facts must &apos; more that the undistorted
If there a issue that not can treat taking in account considerations of short term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy .
The availability and the cost of the electricity on directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies .
It for that a meeting electoral be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear .
The debate only will useful if Further the whole of the consequences economic , social and environmental of the options proposals .
The French must ; their opinion in facts objectives , in data rational .
now that are million of people in the planet , the development demographic afflicted the duplication of the demand electricity before of 2050 , to least that to a huge part of the population world of a element vital .
At same time , will that Admittedly the shortage each time greater of the resources fossil for to have electricity continually , without forget the need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate , a issue that has disappeared the debate ecological .
The accident of not change none of these parameters .
that , Germany it single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear .
That not is the case and of Belgium , that about the their to the need of find a source capable of , and of Switzerland , that only has by aim build central of last generation .
another hand , Great Britain , Finland , Poland , Republic Czech , Netherlands Netherlands , Sweden , South , China , India and Brazil , by quote some examples , are on with determination with their projects .
The States United , by their hand , after you add a unit to their park , the construction of a central after the accident of .
If the model German , based in the energy renewable , is in times as example , the reality is in against of such speech .
The election of Berlin is to mean a the price of the electricity , a greater on energy by the need of gas imported , in particular of Russia , a increase of the emissions of CO2 by the construction of central of gas and of coal .
In a months , the effects harmful .
must on the case of Denmark .
of Europe in the sector , the which this the 30 % of their electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the the wind ; by this reason , their emissions of CO2 and the price of their electricity are , respectively , a 65 % and a 50 % more high that the average European .
the contrary , thanks to the have of our policy energy , our neighbours a bill of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the who French .
While that in a economy needed the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the it of the usefulness industrial in the territory national , the companies French benefit of the electricity more cheap of Europe .
that reason , any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear increasing a strong increase the price of the electricity , what that realism to the statements on the of our country and the defence of our power purchasing .
is of a price that the great majority of the French refuse to pay and , of fact , not opposition by principle to that kind of energy , according show the out .
us that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with jobs of work director and jobs .
looking to the export , encompasses a galaxy of specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not .
If France leave the energy nuclear , increasing the of great part of these SMEs and the loss of the 6 million of EUR year in exports French of equipment and services nuclear .
? What a designed for work Sixty years , when is to the collapse of their manufacturer ?
For as the equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not is a source miracle of production of electricity , the as that not is a source .
The development by part of of solutions with in emissions of CO2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the nature also of the sources of energy .
In the case of the energy nuclear , is essential keep the maximum level of security .
In France , have of a Authority of security that has a control be and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of .
Our equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also not by the security .
In a century , the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious .
Only only one , the of , in in a conditions operational normal ; not resulted consequences and for the people and for the a environment .
In Chernobyl , the accident was the design the into and to a failures human .
In , some people seem forget that the accident was to two disasters natural of a reach without unprecedented , that obviously the death of tens of thousands of people .
The sector nuclear of this accident , such as what was of the two previous .
Thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and spoke French and Germans , the is a design capable of to such phenomena .
While what all the players afraid that want build a central , the with of their construction in would a great gift for the competitors of and , since that them cease to free for in the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear .
It essential and legitimate to the best options for our country , but would irresponsible to that the emotion , the undistorted and the refer a debate so important for the situation economic , social and financial of our country .
The immigration , ? a burden or a opportunity for the economy ?
The policy of immigration applied by Sarkozy has been that since various points of view : the of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the doubts of this policy with the status of &apos; country of the rights human &apos; of France .
than recently , is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has to the headlines , with the Minister of Interior ( the newspaper the 23 of May ) of last that France &apos; not needs foreign , workers and &apos; .
, However , rarely time analysing since the point of view economic .
The question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the left and the right .
In the case of the right , Jacques Chirac the it in 1976 that &apos; unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants &apos; , while that in the left , the tone what Michel indeed that France &apos; not can done office of all the misery the world &apos; in 1990 .
The only difference , the degree of generosity
In 2005 , therefore the left as the right the fear to the invasion the territory national by a a of Poles .
both both , as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society French .
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that act with on to the immigrants .
In their programme , &apos; limited to include , those that the will as the &apos; problem of the migration &apos; .
This idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is why , but economically its very face .
As as quarters the economists Party and saying in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( : World and , May of 2011 , University reporter , . ) , is a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants .
The - of the immigration it the growth and on the employment .
The fears related with the impact of the immigrants on in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national , in particular to the little qualified , recognised for that reduce their wages .
But the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well Commission that substitutes of the workers national and who mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment .
The immigrants little qualified working in sectors that not big to workers national and the more qualified in sectors dynamic where the training not is the demand of personal .
A effect positive on the wages
From same way that a De would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of , the between national and immigrants from that the arrival of these last planned welcome in the wages and the employment of the national .
mind in account what previous , that a increase the 1 % of the flows migratory is a increase of the wages real to long term of between a and a % .
And , without have in account the fact of that the diversity that the immigrants helps to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ( is a great proportion of awarding Nobel Americans and companies as Google , , , and Yahoo were same by immigrants ) .
The immigrants also are taxpayers dig to the systems social , since that of average a 1 % the budget total in the countries European .
The Organisation International the 2.5 estimated , by example , that in Germany a immigrant that it with a age of 30 years Moreover a contribution ( income least expenses ) of EUR to the budgets public of average for all their life .
At principle of their mandate , Sarkozy wanted go to to the points of growth that to &apos; with the the &apos; .
which the , that to the immigrants , had exactly the effect murder .
Europe invented the democracy , only to lack think in a democracy European
The democracy is a well precious , but also fragile .
The continent European should power of this already that , but invented in Athens ago more of two billion years , to what long the century 20th has suffered the tragedies of the War World , , the Holocaust , the had , but also to Franco in Spain , to prohibited in Portugal , the in Greece .
Some perhaps up that , for that the democracy definitively on their enemies , would enough exercise the vote and the way more direct possible .
We , since Rostopchine &apos; the &apos; , that was of something thought .
The suffrage universal , but is of a condition necessary for the democracy , not is enough by itself only and even can become in a &apos; instrument of oppression &apos; , as said found the .
not , the democracy required a more : a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , , solidarity economic and social , justice .
The crisis that we in Europe is a crisis economic , but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic .
The the referendum Greek had , to this on , a as effect intend : was the need of a return take of the sphere policy , but also the worrying that of their Alternatively , of their inconsistency .
must on this ambivalence for .
The truth is that the lines the with of the battle democratic currently have and that , in many cases , the soldiers Republican already not progress in the good sense .
not gaining if We a foundations of referenda national , organised in role of the needs and of way .
A signing in white the European , or a high the vacuum the hole : ! what options for the citizen !
not , not we from coups of effect , but a exercise common , of full right , relaxed and Young , of the options and the democracy , this time to level European .
not there crisis in Greece , Italy , Spain , Portugal ( of fact , not where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of Europe .
The whole of Europe is the that to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of opinion , that the that suffering their the and their lack of solidarity .
is the whole of Europe the that suffering a humiliation in the sphere international .
We much by the transfer of sovereignty to Europe , but is all Europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and , with it , each a of their nations .
What more urgent is that the sovereignty popular ’ the There the project European .
Because only together will the European reduce the weight of their debts , explained of the markets and for their future by the investments .
The exit of the crisis Putting decisions to level European that not will issue without a legitimacy democratic total , unless that be for the disaster .
After have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of Jacques Delors , all the world calls in the currently a governance economic European .
can so be .
But think in it without a greater integration policy and democratic , and without that be as such by the citizens , would a new madness and us would to a new point died .
We in a new stage of the construction European .
For build the Republic in France , was be &apos; to &apos; Republican .
The though motivated by interests not would enough .
This lesson still being applies .
We build a Europe more integrated since the point of view economic .
was will achieve exactly a Europe more democratic in the level political , a real sovereignty popular European .
For build Europe , us European .

The Stream , new door of entry the gas Russian in Europe
The pipeline Stream , that directly Europe Western with Russia and by the fund the Sea Baltic , already has since in service .
must supply gas for satisfy the needs of 30 million of who .
Gazprom , the heralded Russian the gas , has wanted there the event with great .
The last Tuesday , more of 500 invited , including four Heads of State and of Government , took to on the Baltic , between the music of the and a delicate , in the opening the Stream , the new pipeline that directly , under the sea , Russia with Germany .
, the Chancellor German Angela Angela , the President Russian a.m. Medvedev , the Prime Minister French &apos; and their counterpart of the Netherlands Netherlands , Mark , have together the of the that controls the entry of gas Russian in the network of Europe Western .
With this new pipeline , each year than million of metres runs of gas Russian additional to Europe Western to through of a first had of km that the region of St Petersburg with the of .
A Secondly should to end of 2012 that will supply a total of million of metres runs of gas , is say , enough for cover all the consumption French .
In , already about of the possibility of build a third by the same way .
For Gazprom , the completion to time of this huge labour is of victory .
Poland and the countries Baltic had therefore strongly the project .
fact , the Stream is to allow supply gas directly to Germany , any the course earth by third countries ( Poland and Ukraine ) .
coup , these two countries Some something of their power : for them , will more difficult influence in Russia with the access to the markets of Europe Western .
In the point the debate , Warsaw not in easy the Stream as a &apos; new pact &apos; , in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for should Poland in .
is say , if the issue is politically delicate .
Europe Western , support the project Russian , has obtained a greater security of supply .
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of the energy , given that the project has led a gap between the European the this and the in .
Russia has known , in so only five years , to their vision of a alliance direct between Russia and the countries Western rich , large consumers of gas and with a reserves each time more limited .
&apos; This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia , a new that us unite of way result &apos; , this &apos; for the opening the pipeline , proving to what point the large contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic .
All this is the broad everywhere in the sides of the that of Gazprom , many in , in the point of arrival the gas .
The construction of this pipeline also is a achievement technical .
The is made of steel of rebuild for against the of the ships .
supports in the fund the sea , to a average of 200 values of depth .
For , was necessary avoid camps of mines that Traces of the Second War World .
&apos; was necessary with or destroy a of them , by caution &apos; , out , spokesman of the society Stream .
also , s necessary best the measures of protection of the , and the flora .
The is a long word of metal that is as 242 and not is interrupted in all their length : and by , and by stations of it .
was measures a platform of control in the waters of Sweden , but the responsible the project to the same the see that the Swedish not were very prepared to allow that a society state Russian of way permanent in the sea with to their coast .
&apos; In case of , the step the gas in least of a minute &apos; , precise .
In case of flight , the gas the pipeline , by therefore , to the atmosphere .
But the spoke they little likely that would a flight , since that have to that , according the forecasts , will a flight each precursor years .
The control the state the pipeline an by a robot , by a per , that for inspections external , so as by a has that circulate by the internal the pipeline .
With the way of a pure , predictability in the internal the , that has a diameter of a metre , and all with the gas .
their arrival , after three hours minutes of journey to a speed of three metres by Secondly , country data precise on possible the metal .
The pipeline has been designed for work for fifty years without need of no kind of .
The movement the gas an simply by the pressure .
At principle is of 200 and , to the exit of 100 .
Five companies have joined their forces for power to to out this project .
The company leader is Gazprom , that has the 51 % of the financially .
it , the German and ( % each a ) , so as the busy and the group French ( 9 % each one ) .
These five societies have created a company common , so-called Stream , that of build and exploiting the pipeline .
It their based in , Switzerland , where the old is especially favourable .
After , Gazprom to this society , for a term of this years renewable , the whole of the capacities of transport of gas .
&apos; Gazprom to payments by the capacity total , regardless of the amount of gas that really transport &apos; , precise .
The funding of the construction the pipeline has taken just in a 30 % with the contribution of the and in a 70 % by loans Serious .
The cost total of the labour should achieve million of EUR for the two .
For , by example , the investment has reached the million .
But the A are insurance of that not their investment , since that Gazprom here by itself only the risk of the expenses .
The pipeline the Baltic in , in a at of .
for , with 4.5 metres of at , are the door of exit the gas .
are a sensors that the pressure , the temperature and the characteristics specific the gas to the arrival , before of that sums to the pipelines Germans .

But there a party that around and a rival , Bosnia , that defeat .
mind in account the party of ( ) , the Friday in the hell of , seems clear that the thing not is my .
Portugal delayed the party for more of a time , itself , but not could in the valuable that to would given the anything .
&apos; is a good result , but to the time means a risk , since that not have there outside of home &apos; .
But in home , in the bright of the of Lisbon , the Portuguese are much of that , to a public that should be as of happy , even if is clear that the party &apos; is very matched &apos; , a positive but .
&apos; We that the party is very matched , but are completely much of that we take the &apos; , declared the you Portuguese of 42 years .
