the victory of libya
the history of the liberation libia , or of the rebellion libia , already has their losers .
muammar el-gaddafi was befriended in a place secret in the desert and he already not there war .
is define who is the vencedor
as is already preparation in the region , the islamists ganaron the elections , but now is of dilucidar if is of correct or radical
the council national of transition has done into in force the law traditional , the sharía , already in true way know .
libya will in a country crime , because to the honour them cortará the hand .
the women already can go olvidando of emanciparse and the apóstatas waiting their execution and sucesivamente .
in place of the person the dictator , the society , independent of hill guerreras , question the koran .
in libya set a order not we we not imagine and certainly not we .
however , our way of life not is or the only or objective the best and , probably , not them betraying , in change , to the libyans already smaller .
what true is that not is of stunning that the enemies muslim enforced agradecidos the aid of the dogs infieles .
the only justification was that , since their point of view , the attacks of the nato not respected a general us , but large be ala , whose greatness were after every one of the speeches successful .
when are vencedores in libya , west not is between them .
are trapped in a shootout the serve the islamists and our politicians to crawling of a dictator in the person of a ally political that has guarantees of obtain profits .
after the recent poor experiences of afghanistan and iraq , not our libya militarily .
in this case , to the premises not them is a problem eject to the &quot; crusaders &quot;
but , occupation ¿ make the petroleras done with the gold black libio only with good words ?
is some possible not , but can be that finally west can presumir of protect rights human .
always the followers of the sharía not we crossing .

menu every of a child obeso : not desayuna and dinner analogues
more of a third of the children with age present between the 9 and 13 years have problems of obesity , where the obesity affects the 9 % of the population school and the obesity 5 % .
the children overweight come in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life not is healthy , that from of research current .
again to demonstrate what is the importance the environment where overall to a development healthy of the person , as the models serve of reference .
in the table , the children obsesos deplored , example , of analogues the least with the double of often the children of families with weight normal .
to eat , more the 19 % of the overweight had cenado potatoes fritas the day before the analysis , the which is linked the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity not is a casualidad &quot; .
in the families of children with obesity not there preparation of should sports , what which is applicable to the majority of the families current , where only the 15 % of the children did that their parents , at least a time week , are time to the exercise physical .
survey relevant to 900 children
the survey was to end the last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of education básica of the liberec .
already was the second edition the programme of &quot; the obesity of not is a casualidad &quot; , that supports the company of sure sanitario general and the company unilever .
to now , have participated in the project more of 12 thousand children since the 4º to the 8º course .
a dieta appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors determinantes , do decrease contribution the number of children with obesity and even obesity .
&quot; only the half of the children encuestados have would that have five lunches everyday according the regime : breakfast , lunch , food , merienda and dinner , is one of the conditions in to a dieta healthy &quot; , other one of the results of the survey .
breakfast but with embutido to eat
the specialists avisan of that , in a development healthy , are important , also , the details , also have , as example have a time closest to the breakfast in family .
in liberec , not however , only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren desayunan to the same time .
in the majority of the families , every one desayuna only .
but what worst was be that in the 10 % of the homes not desayuna nothing .
the breakfast is , however , the basis of a dieta daily right .
the study shows that in the families of children overweight consume with need more often the insanas potatoes fritas .
almost all - regardless the weight - haul to every refrescos dulces ( 70 % ) .
rule general do sport more the 40 % of the children encuestados , however , entres their parents this result reduces to least of the half , only the 15 % .
fabrícate your dieta
the next stage the study posibilitó that the chavales elected ( 204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools ) creasen their propias diets to from of all the takeover possible according their tastes and views .
&quot; the preferences food of the children czech in age present between the 12 and 15 years , since the point of view of a food healthy , are very regard of what ideal . &quot;
between their food preferred are the pasta , the meat and the dulces
&quot; is on all alarming the popularity of the refrescos dulces &quot; , warned in the report final the study .
as food main has the palma the pasta and you is of closely the meat of sagrada .
virtually , the children reject always the legumbre and the will the fish and the i is very low .
change to habits healthy
the same time , the study shows that the children are ready to change their habits food if receive the information fair .
&quot; in the group of control of the participants in the study , rellenaron the cuestionario after of end the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity not is a casualidad &quot; , was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy &quot; , suggests in the results the study .
is the attention , example , main to the refrescos dulces , where many children empezarían to preferir the water normal and aware .
the children also elegirían with more often in the cuestionario the meat of sagrada and the fish to the food main and restringirían the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of harina .
the estilista has of be also a good guillermo , maintain the occupational
in the article introductorio , how learn the estilistas , already i quejé a little of that the lessons initial already were quite cargadas .
not had not idea of how would what .
conferences of three professionals the ramo , how wear to individuals problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world the entertainment .
and will although .
by more closely are the examinations final , more information and tasks practical we aguardan
and although the course develops every saturday and sunday , already not be a alfiler .
are time have examined with the director , alena , ( in the course not there no man ) on how wear to the woman not has a simetría perfect .
and is the great majority .
someone is cuellicorto , someone has a issues estilizada the curvas right and someone suffering obesity .
the estilista has of know arise ópticamente a shoulders anchos , alargar a bottleneck or recrear the curvas necessary
we have given certain grist on how do emphasise the body of women the kind of jennifer valverde , of pechos and caderas enormous but cintura close and same time not vestirla of a way too desafiante
if , example , it difference between the cintura and the caderas is so the falda or the trousers not adaptan , is the penalty have coser the least a paper of abkhazia extra to measure .
doubt not arrepentirán , because the clothes where perfectly is impagable .
with a falda to measure agreed much best that with a not to of start , levantarse , baila in the cintura , etc.
the body estilizado can allow wear clothes with pliegues , adornos , bordados or drapeados .
there certainly many types of information and of bodies , that am happy of that have of the the week to put order in my head the this information .
e even , i fear that with the task asignada , already have more of have .
to every participant in the course you have allocated two famosos , to the must look two vestuarios : one to the day and one to the night .
there that have in account the aspect current , the lifestyle of fashionable adecue to the person in question .
i has tocado &quot; wear &quot; to miranda kerr , perhaps the conozcáis of the campaign of victory &apos; at secret .
out within , to me is much best that , example , britney spears or christina aguilera , recently will engordado a hundred agent ( favour , have in account the excessive ) , or the jovencísima selena gómez .
the their have that recortarlos of the weeklies or buscarlos in internet and imprimirlos , to after elaborarlos graphically .
the moodboard , is as is result complete , expressed also our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design gráfico .
is important also think in the part gráfica the estilismo .
the estilista , therefore , not viste only physically , but also is , example , of the pages of products in the weeklies ( of subjects specific , as trends , bolsos , coats , etc. ) .
of all we spoke the estilista and leather mario kameník .
but all this already is to the sunday .
the estilista has of have a vision global .
the three invited especialistas encouraged the conference the saturday with information on all kind of bodies .
the estilista honza pokorný , the leather of fashionable jakub polanka and the fotógrafo of fashionable ben renč .
jakub we reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the estilista should saberle from party to this .
and a good estilista know work with a same prenda of wear of forms .
the variabilidad is , in this case , fundamental .
, it gabardina ( or as say in english , trench-coat ) can wear to what stale with vaqueros and camiseta , but also serves to wear the body ridden with shoes of tacón and fotografiarlo as if it in reality a reasonable .
or well is arremangarla and go the bottleneck to obtain a image completely different .
&quot; jugad with &quot; , we stressed .
what more valoro is the next council : &quot; to start to work , ago lack that first conozcáis all the rules &quot; .
&quot; then already tell romperlas &quot; , said jakub .
end i is clear what memorizamos all these developments , being with what , what , if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable we are results different .
that speak of the desfiles .
thanks the fotógrafo ben , know that a estilista has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the is fotografiar .
, to a history of fashionable have ten pages ( therefore , ten outfits ) , there that have splendid , lists to use , the least quince .
and also that the photos the clothes works in combination with other prendas , all them different to the cannot in the reality .
all there that must in account to the time of look the outfit .
honza pokorný we was that the image and the lifestyle pose them alone , in many cases , the half the success .
is look to madonna , not is precisely a berber extraordinary , but the image and the márquetin have done of she a star global .
in liberec , the time , not there still a trend clear to use the services of the estilistas .
to the individuals famous also what are pointless ( i cannot my skills , my aspect physical not has so importance ) .
and when someone we pida our services , there that have in account that is very likely that we indiquen a stature very different to the their real ( will ) .
then only is guglear and abused if the weeklies the heart already have written on the issue , if a a celebridad has engordado / adelgazado , etc.
the sunday , honza and mario we insistieron in the estilista not you is orientarse in the fashionable , but has that understand of outfit .
for their work , on all must communicate with the people to the viste , what is fundamental be a good guillermo .
know appreciate to the people , not ago of least , is their views .
&quot; when a director you contrata to that you clasifiquéis the vestuario and completéis with prendas fine , not tell catch and throwing all what had and say : &quot; huy what horror &quot; &quot; .
&quot; encontrad the least a couple of things podáis ponderar and recommend to that someone can put &quot; , says mario .
he same also we was that all must caber in the called &quot; placovka &quot; , is say , the exchange of work .
this set around of the cintura and have all the tools necessary .
are items as tijeras , as tijeras , quitapelusas , or imperdibles . there also balance of nailon ( you serves to estilista for the session of photos of products such bolsos or gorros ) , pinzas special of enganche of prendas ahead , if this would greater ( the alfileres and another kind of enganches not are permitidos , because could damage the fabric ) , or a game of remnant .
to not quedarnos in the heard pasiva and put something in practical , have learned to revestir the suela of the shoes .
even for the sessions of photos in the study , in a surface flat , could damage the suela and much more still the protocol .
and not did more that revestir and revestir .
not cannot play the shoes with the tijeras to not dañarlos accident .
had that be very hábil .
mario i has given a joy pay my work reserves .
the truth is that not i are very well these skills .
this is only one small part of all the have heard for all the end of week , in the second part the course .
already i i given account that dedicarme the estilismo to level professional not is a way of view , but i is exactly as what telling the people .
in need at speed : the run competing the america .
account
a journey , in principle despreocupado , complicates to cause of a series of descuidos impropios of a journey routine for the time of morning .
in a measure managed cover the expectations , but not serves of nothing , if , in reality , not intended do nothing exceptional .
the new over , to the the title adds the run , kindled large expectations already before of their estreno .
prometía that would new aires to the former saga of things need at speed and , to result of what shown , is as a game not should end being another time a gender of action more .
also we feel curiosos know how live the scenes insertadas , where the inspiration main falling the car and walking their own ordinary .
as is happen in the series of nfs , the results not vary great thing regard to what we been .
there things can give acceptable , but in the cómputo total some points to cause of failures absurd , already come apareciendo in the series since ago years .
in reality not can or blend errors , but is more well of the desgana incomprehensible of the programadores .
the adventure starts very well .
you introduces in a history , whose protagonista , nicklaus , has certain problems personal ; to resolverlos , you offers participate in a career illegal the america .
you sentáis the volante in the coast sumptuous , in st franz , and your mission is come the first to new york .
the idea is offer something interesting .
the route divides in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty things .
of follows that every career has place a route different and the stages are localizadas in different forestry , are quite wide and interesting .
of that way , one not has not remotamente the feeling of that the game will always what same .
some of the forestry are even agradables to the view , although the level technical the gráfico is equivalent of evidence previous of the series .
therefore , not is nothing the another world .
but the region the desert , the landscape otoñal or the highest mountains covered of snow is a effect about very afraid .
also , the things diversifican of time in when a element atípico .
, example , in the desert you encontráis a storm of bit ever the visibility .
in change , in the mountains there that have care to that not you sepulte a avalancha .
that that , every one of the things is very well developed .
only there a couple of models , but with that is .
for a time , intentáis adelantar to a amount of rivales exigida ( what normal in a career classical ) , after tratáis of win time ( duel stale cronometrado ) and then you expected a duel against a only adversario .
in of all this is to times the police , not ago but obstruct still more the things .
the odysseus are the landscape would the car .
have animaciones interactivas when nicklaus , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and do you that ayudarlo , always pulsando the botón fair in the time fair .
nothing complicated .
is surprising , however , that has a least landscape in the game of what be wait ( in particular there only three ) .
but the result final is positive , because this element not is to be upsetting and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements do that the game making more interesting .
the model of driver is the fingerprints of the episodes previous .
that want say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not can say that be bad .
if buscáis a simulación realistic , already tell seek in another part .
but to a career by with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of driver , although we find something best between the games of the competition .
even here , all in order .
but the problems arise after of a a time .
to difference of what correct of the models of driver , already not happens what same with the collisions .
of games of this kind not be wait that recree deformaciones and collisions difficult , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not tell predict how reaccionará vuestro prosecution , with what which not all is in order .
is typical that , the do a adelantamiento very ajustado or be the prosecution with a traffic normal , so only has light roces , but in other situations almost identical , vuestro prosecution has doing piruetas descontroladas .
or even has completely destruido .
thanks the system of reseteo , not arise large problems , but can poneros of humour .
the reseteos are programados of way , when sufres a accident or you sales of the back , the game you restituye to last point of rescue in the back .
however , in every career only have of five reseteos available .
if the consumís all , you that restart the career since the principle .
because not is more a aid in case of that something not will well , but not is very of fiar .
to times , or the reseteo aid , only does the aprenderse the stage tremendous of memory .
a great disadvantage the game is that the same facts are in different places .
in some curvas , example , there that into of a way specific ; of another way , are imposibles of take .
other times you encontráis in some website vehicles &quot; civil &quot; always with the same configuration , although estéis the first , quintos or lleguéis five minutes before or after .
this ago of rabiar on all in situations , when veis that two autos will meeting in directions diametrically , your contrincante adelanta problems , but when llegáis , debéis girar or well direct .
is as when lleguéis , because is programmed that the &quot; surprise &quot; always will ahead of vuestras narices .
the adversaries have also a advantage more .
for the the starting llegaréis to websites where , have in account the time , always you adelantará the same adversario in the same website .
also this happens the end of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is still more chocante .
vuestro oponente must come before that fine , at price that be .
when is ahead of fine , you makes the vision of the autos that come of with , the principle tell do papilla the car .
can understand the idea of create a game with máximas deal of suspense and adrenalina , but the execution is so apparent surely you decepcione indeed .
and is a penalty , because although the model the journey be simple , the game is fun and with action , of way to often not is possible continue the detail what is or longer .
and really is just , if the merit has the idea with fifty runs unique or the classification in the career to that not quepa the platitude , or any another thing .
a idea inhabitual is the change of autos for the things .
you that be vigilant to the surtidores of petrol hand of the road , because exactly you that change of prosecution , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what you .
the autos into in three categories .
sport are suitable to areas urban , the autos strong american to the motorways rectas and the exóticos superdeportivos to a driver technical , example , roads of mountain with curvas .
also balance narrativo main also is a balance of challenges parallel , is say , there things in places specific conoceréis the stories .
here conseguiréis not only medals , but also points of experience to vuestro profile , serves therefore to the challenges as the cuentos .
the achieve the level higher , the driver you go several possibilities , beginning the prosecution and acabando with funds to the profile .
the same time , there conectada a role autolog in line , highlights vuestros results with the of other players and disponibiliza other duties community .
one of the elements more difficult of understand is how is pale the last career in the history .
with the car llegáis to the tunnel the metre ( pass ) , where you ponéis to cause to oscuras the ways ( pass ) .
the velocímetro you signals between 150 and 200 km / at ( pass ) and , of suddenly , behind you is the convoy the metre and you has ahead more .
in the wording surely will a discussion on this for several days , on if for the programming the game none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take a panda of bobos .
the part technical the game not is nothing exceptional , but at least the effects visuales general are in the majority of the cases agradables , to times to soberbios .
because what penalty , in the at more tensos reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a way serious .
this affects on all to the accidents where there involucrados many participants , when the quality of image continual already not is valid .
the that is well and the broadband sonora is a question of tastes .
to end of that be the agrado to the greater part the group youth , the broadband sonora belongs to the category &quot; every one of their father and of their mother &quot; , but can mean that nobody torment the game only their music .
the feeling final of need at speed : the run is because quite confusing .
if the game evitase errors absolutely stupid , we we problems in say the run is the best game of nfs of the last years .
is the feeling of that the game not is completed .
the diversión is asegurada , but preparaos because the errors you might in the eyes with the force of a reflectores of airport .

the new since of representative of the policy foreign and security is to from of the question : &quot; ¿ who is this eu ? ¿ to what number can llamarla ? &quot; . is because of a step important to the unification and the clarification of of the union political of face to states as china or india .
nobody want prohibirnos the cheese of olomouc
vicenová has occupied also of the agenda was , is and will the council european in the future next .
the presidency czech of ago two years was a success .
czech raised of the crisis economic potential , were the crisis the gas and organised a summit to the partnership eastern .

how have there the prices of the travel since 1989
to 1989 had in the czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state you : čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea and autoturist .
the agencies of travel of at time vendían in the majority of the cases travel only bloc socialist , because the travel to west were very restringidos .
the tourists czech would , therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the sprinkler ( republic democratic s ) , to the union soviet , ( sochi in crimea in the sea black ) to bulgaria and romania ( ambas in the sea black ) and to hungary ( balaton ) .
a exception positive was the period aware between 1962 and 1972 , when could travel to yugoslavia , however , after the regime yugoslavo inclinó to the west and the travel of the tourists czech were then some restringidos .
a great somewhat the socialism was the fact to the citizens the bloc socialist ( or be , also to the checoeslovacos ) not them permitiese travel free and individually or even the countries socialist .
if a citizen wanted travel individually , example , to poland or to the union soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the journey individual not was possible .
the agencies of journey ofrecían in those times also travel west , but one should put to the eu with a together of taking and happen the the night , or have &quot; good known &quot; in the agency .
still not all was cattle .
the called &quot; promise of change &quot; that was the condition to the travel west , not concedía to the &quot; people politically little reliable &quot; , that not could travel in all .
the currency checoslovaca not was a currency freely converted and , guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency western ) to travel to west .
the great majority of the czech become their holiday in their own country , what had a great number of bonemeal and houses of summer , that the czech adquirían . this preparation still persiste .
the way of travel of the czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution .
while to 1989 to us was the not is more happen the holiday in the sprinkler or bulgaria , the year last the czech did 4,5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world .
is nna great somewhat , of the today day already not are aware , the fact of the destination currently favourite , croatia , to 1989 not could travel freely , because was part of the yugoslavia of then .
to principles of the years 90 imposed the exemption of visa to travel to the states neighbours of europe western , what was a wave huge of visits of shorter duration , sobretodo to vienna or germany .
the checoeslovacos , for a time , not pretended hartos of the excursiones west , all the world wanted verlo the what least a time .
example , in paris dormían the groups liberated czech in the parks in shops of campaign , already our income of then not we permitían pay a hotel or pension .
a feature typical of the czech of at time was the be brought the food ( tomatoes , analogues , etc. ) to save .
another time important was the introduction of the convertibilidad of the nickel czech , our tourists were finally , after of decades , buy freely currency western .
our level of life aumentaba and with he also the wages resources , what around of 1997 was a increase in the demand of travel .
with the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies , to from of 1997 with issue , to preparing the travel using the links of flights chárter , what was come incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the past , thanks to the possibility of obtain respondents the volume of passengers .
to end of the 90 the century last , already the czech found visa to almost all the countries developed , exception ee.uu. , what which simplificó still more our travel .
another time interesting in the history the tourism pos-revolucionario happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thanks to a huge demand , the first flight direct since liberec to a country exótico , and was to thailand .
since at year , proceed all the years flights chárter direct with tourists czech was countries distant and calurosos . this winter already volará directly since liberec to 12 destinations exóticos .
the countries exóticos the their currently closely of 100 thousand czech year .
another time interesting of this time , symbolises our development pos-revolucionario , was in the year 2008 .
the 17 of november of 2008 , ee.uu. squeezed the visa to the tourists czech , with what our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world .
in 2008 the czech , first time in their history , have happened more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50,3 % ) and first time in their history , have located in travel foreign more of 15 thousand coronas blatant head , including the expenditure in the website of stay .
dead house general ordinaria to choose the president , could end of new in point dead .
since ago almost five months the football czech is president and is likely that the successor of ivan hašek as president of the federation czech of futbol ( fačr ) , not conocerá or after the call of the next house general extraordinary will place this thursday in nymburk .
of done , still not has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to continue .
the same , not will vote even to choose between the three candidates .
the interested to presidir the football czech are jindřich rajchl , miroslav pelta and tomáš paclík .
hašek renunció to their office in june not before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong supiese means the football in the future .
however , after of conclude it era hašek , used a controversy between the two federaciones of the partnership unable of come to a agreement to are a candidate common .
became in fact the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president .
the delegates of the house general met in vain in the home national ( národní dům ) , on in the area praguense of smíchov , because the discussions had blocked and not only in as method of election .
not was to no consensus or in as to who in the house general had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the delegates with full powers .
to from of that time and because to this only point , in a agreement this , broadly also the recommendation the institute of state and right , according the which the representation full powers not is possible .
however , the disputes on the code electoral are open .
more light on the situation already not could throw not the committee executive that , in their meetings , ordinarias or extraordinary , basically not falls nothing .
the opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already , but the point ourselves is being the same .
the question is the next : ¿ of what way proceed in the third round to avoid the point dead ?
&quot; the dispute about in on to if must proceed of agreement with the estatutos or find another model &quot; , says dušan svoboda , one of the three vicepresidentes of the fačr , , since the direction of the partnership , represents the futbol professional .
according the model proposed in the estatutos , in the third round are at candidate have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy .
the region of moravia is ready to come to a compromise to that can win at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both federaciones .
the part bohemia , however , needs the condition of that the winner , according these side porcentuales , should have the majority of the least two thirds .
&quot; this you quitaría , however , the sense to the two rounds previous and negaría complete the concept of system bicameral &quot; , is as svoboda understand the concerns of the part morava , that which what best would not play the order and vote that estatutos files .
with what , surprisingly , is of agreement also tomaš paclík , although is that the regulation electoral established the estatutos of all the candidates be more to pelta .
&quot; i like that votara the full of agreement with the estatutos &quot; .
&quot; to that not inventen no tontería about of the representatives as in the last house general &quot; , says the cold of victory plzen , postula first time as candidate and is their comments mainly in against of pelta .
pelta is being positive .
according he , in nymburk decide on the new president and he believe that the candidates in the future cooperaran of way constructive .
&quot; all the pasiones apaciguarán with the party of today of our team national in the championship european .
&quot; the football will to be protagonista , and cooperara more to will &quot; says the representative the jablonice , of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to level professional as regional .
rajchl is the more reticent .
&quot; hope that comes to a agreement , but , unfortunately , the situation is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; not is the conflict between bohemios and moravos , but there attempts of ajustar the rules to their own convenience . &quot;
&quot; this can have as result a new deadlock of the house general . &quot;
&quot; of all case , hope that present the sense common &quot; , said rajchl .
already not is a time to that all the parties come to a agreement .
some negotiations had that take in montenegro , but ¿ who can know to that start the party if the team of football will complete ?
the air special , in the had that travel to podgorica , between other the vicepresidentes dalibor kucera and rajchl , not has this morning problems technical in prague , taking that buscarse a alternative to carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification .
quizas the meeting decisive , end , could be the will place to level ministerial , , that have , will this wednesday .
to josef dobeš , minister of education , youth and sports , you like much integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country to that comes to a agreement .
there a in game : the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next house general the committee central of the federation checoslovaca the sport ( čstv ) that increase made of a new direction sport czech after the problems financial of the home of loterías sazka .
paclík luchará achieve the presidency , because not is a candidate more appropriate .
if the head of the futbolistas of pilsen , tomaš paclik , before of the house general extraordinary conociera the name of a candidate appropriate satisficiese all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football ( fačr ) , or would as candidate to a since so relevant .
&quot; if would a person appropriate , would fighting she and not i would as candidate to the elections . &quot;
&quot; but to the day of today not has been find a person &quot; , said paclík to the agency of news czech ( čtk )
what justifies to paclík to into in the challenge with miroslav pelta and henry rajchl is exactly the possibility of block to pelta , the course winner of the elections , opens the way to the presidency of the federation czech of futbol ( fačr ) .
paclík also puntualiza that , in case through , permanecería in the office of president only to 2013 , when become the time of the house general ordinary .
in that office you like see to a expert and good workforce not is too related with the events derisory .
&quot; already i spoken with some people to the could have in account &quot; .
&quot; to me was a madness hear to some say that in this time or even want identify with the football czech . &quot;
&quot; i like change vision &quot; , adds .
what supposed more bother to paclík in this time is the relationship of pelta with the president of the partnership of football regional of pilsen pianist berbr , a man with a past controversial , known would the mundillo as a poderoso lobista with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the house general .
to paclík is so unacceptable see to pelta clear in the sillón presidential .
&quot; in case of gane , hold the status existing and nothing in the football will &quot; .
&quot; with the support of berbra , a man of business ambitious , the football surrendering still least advantage &quot; , said paclík .
mentions also the fact of ago a years the name of pelta was related with a heard telephone for the research of a case of corruption , of the which pelta went impune .
&quot; not know what prestige football could bring the victory of pelta . &quot;
&quot; and with what eyes we plead the uefa and the fifa &quot; , said paclík , also take with a caution their declaration previous &quot; vendería the club pilsen if pelta become in president &quot; .
in the case of win the elections the thursday , paclík could be the cooperation with pelta in the future .
of same opinion is the another candidate , rajchl , has been supported paclík before of the house general of september that was in a fiasco .
&quot; he ( pelta ) would the first the represent &quot; .
&quot; is very capable . &quot;
&quot; i what could imagine , example , as head of the representation &quot; .
&quot; but not as workforce of a partnership &quot; .
&quot; i not meto the narices there where not i am capable &quot; , added paclík , in september suscitó a attention support the from of the commission of referees presidida ludek macel , potential after dagmar damkova .
paclík accepts that atrevería to manage the partnership .
particularly to their capacities of management of the companies private , because since the summer last is also the director the pilsen , with their support took in may the triunfo in first division .
&quot; have force to change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , probably tend to influence in the decisions the committee past and of appellate , have situations unpleasant , said paclík hidden their antipatías to the president the sparta daniel křetínský .
one of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the fačr and the committee olímpico czech , with the aid the which ejercía pressure on the leaders political to that go more money sport of the taxes of the lottery .
&quot; is one of the problems key the should conducting the new president . &quot;
&quot; if aumentaran the taxes on the games of gambling , as anuncian the parties political , support their arguments , but , frankly , have that tell where is to stop all this money &quot; , .
ademas , paclík now not has in account even their partnership with the club pilsner , although he same says that the president of the fačr must be &quot; not an &quot; .
pelta is to their time related with jablonec and rajchl with dukla of prague .
&quot; not is ideal . &quot;
&quot; but not see sense the fact of yield hypocritically my actions the club of pilsen to another person to then return there after a year and &quot; , said paclík .
pelta promised to the fačr new estatutos acabarían with the point dead of the elections .
two days before of the house general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency , miroslav pelt , promised that , in case of be elected , coordinating that the fačr had a new estatutos sirvieran definitely to put , in the future , the controversy in as the regulation electoral .
the representative the jablonec is positive in as to the meeting of this thursday in nymburk , and believe that the conflict preelectoral could move to a solution today with the possible victory the team of football .
already before of the elections not by in september , pelta promised look , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in have funds .
decided participate in the last minute in the last house general , what this order of two months you could go well to defend and present , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management the football .
&quot; the people of all the levels is the football already ago a time and expected know this thursday at new president . &quot;
&quot; feel that has come the time of that someone gestione the partnership &quot; , think the man couples mainly with the club of jablonice , but worked in the sparta and in the committee executive of the partnership .
this reason , believe have enough experience to manage the football czech .
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria hung in the time of ivan hašek .
&quot; unfortunately , in the house general of june were cause the estatutos not were so useless as all felt . &quot;
&quot; if excluimos certain interpretations , have a president already since september &quot; , warned pelta .
exactly the readaptación the document more important of the partnership cívica usó as señuelo to gain to the delegates .
&quot; if i eligen president , i having as a challenge personal and am ready to respond in case of that this falle . &quot;
&quot; is a question of principles , the which not we there &quot; , says pelta .
also , in theory , is not fight with their opponents .
already in the past had your that was working with henry rajchl , at that respects their training in right , being aware of that their oponente would also their first of .
already was a time attack to case paclík who , the otherwise of pelta , not he pawn with head .
&quot; has more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes . &quot;
&quot; their attacks but were vergonzosos and a people became the campaign electoral . &quot;
&quot; that many of them dudan on their real nature &quot; , said to their opponent pelta , is being faithful to the statements announced already in september .
their weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , since the sports more low to the tariffs .
this last should be escaparate of promotion the football .
&quot; also , intentaría put all the escándalos arose to cause of the bohemians as result the scandal of corruption the year last . &quot;
&quot; immediately after i involucraría in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , to ensure that has enough money to all the football &quot; , said ago two months to the čtk the candidate of 46 years .
to continuation also promised that their appointment as president the football not comportaría no modification personal of the plantilla .
&quot; tendría know first the tasks of every empleado &quot; , said give to strahov where , after a long period of anarquía , has a nerviosismo comprehensible .
to despite of the scenarios satisfied current vaticinan to the next house general , he believe that the delegates not travel in vain this thursday to nymburk .
&quot; if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , doubt what we overcome .
&quot; the football needs credibility , the which will only if end has a leader &quot; , still two days before of the hours more decisive in their career of representative , pelta is being positive .
rajchl promised , that under their leadership , the fačr empezaría to work with politics .
if in the quarter house general control elected the current of jindrich rajchl as new president of the partnership of football czech , a people will surely resentida .
rajchl promised that , in case of be elected , trabajaría hard .
want implement a change systematic and do that the member the committee executive are responsible of every area the football individually .
also compromises to resolve the case of the bohemians , improve the relations with the uefa and the fifa , get more money to the football and continue with the work started the previous president ivan hašek .
&quot; as president , i like dedicarme complete the football &quot; .
&quot; since the contacts international with the uefa and the fifa to the selection , happening the football professional or the numbers of young futbolistas of high performance . &quot;
&quot; with this not i say that would all only &quot; , said rajchl in a interview to the čtk .
&quot; i a player of team and i destroy the powers the committee executive of way that every member can deal to a area stating . &quot;
&quot; and asignaré tasks difficult to that the football can , in every one of these segmentos , continue forward with much momentum &quot; .
&quot; to a people this probably not you gustará , because mean start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the other &quot; , added .
due to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement futbolístico , says that has considered the possibility of not stand of new as candidate .
&quot; all know , that work 20 hours everyday . &quot;
&quot; but need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that i would and obstaculizará to every step &quot; , explain the reasons of their indecisión .
&quot; a people i has said that not i darme overcome , because then give vencidos also the others &quot; .
&quot; is of have faith to not leave , more &quot; , said .
that say , you justifies also continue the work already began with hašek .
&quot; for these two years , was a great part the work not i that now vanish &quot; .
&quot; there processes had started and will their effect within of a couple of years and not i like that someone pare &quot; , announced concerned the fact of that , if eligieran the another candidate , miroslav pelta , the situation in the partnership could return to be as was before of the time of hašek .
&quot; i i in the order , and is something , in my opinion , mirek pelta not is capable of keep .
&quot; behind of he is on all the that people ocuparía the football to that outside only a privilege to a few elected . &quot;
&quot; i can reprochar a lot of things , but not the fact of that am to favour of someone . &quot;
&quot; defend be aim . &quot;
&quot; i do a football to all , because only sentirán well all and not only the elected &quot; , said rajchl .
is also the idea that only serious bohemian the president .
&quot; although some people trying say otherwise , have in mind do what full moravia . &quot;
&quot; example , is time of think in the fact of destroy the second division in a part czech and in another morava , whose winners irían to the first division &quot; .
&quot; not would the situation current in the have only three equipment of moravia , what represents a problem to the players moravos young &quot; , said rajchl .
although to the pugna of the elections presidential sumó tomaš paclík , president the club pilsner , rajchl not is of believe in their possibilities of be elected .
&quot; still am have a strong support of the federation czech , the which i was as their of and know that behind of me there successes clear &quot; , said rajchl , whose successes understand the savings of a tens of million of coronas of contracts desventajosos , the negotiations of contracts televisivos and the negotiations on the law of the lottery .
another hand , recognised their part of fault in the federation not is united .
and while claims that pelta is &quot; descalificado to recover the confidence in the football czech &quot; , as the another rival , paclík , as a candidate strong has something offer the football .
&quot; nobody can is that was a great work the pilsen at year &quot; .
&quot; in the case of that be elected , probably will what already began ivan hašek and not cambiaria of way significant the plantilla the staff in the committees . &quot;
&quot; not i use that to my favour &quot; , evalúa to their rivales rajchl .
the pools more fine of europe
step the blue
of stanek
pools since a optical incredible , exquisite bathing in budapest : who visit europe can live their maravilla blue , and , after a visit to the city or a caminata , rejoin their piernas cansadas in bathing burbujeantes .
a book shows where is the best welfare in the water .
when issue meder was a journey of research for the year and average past , had something not could faltar in their luggage , a bañador .
tumbada of wall on the water , looked the artistic cúpula in what high , nadaba to the angelotes of mármol , it were in the on of the well and asombraba to the well cubierta modernista restaurada meticulosamente .
you did the bathing , took note in their libreta time of all the details interesting on the lifestyle and the history the building .
the historiadora arquitectónica meder exploró more of 200 pools of this way and is in their recent book &quot; badefreuden &quot; : the pools covered in munich , the historical palaces the bathing in the jungle black , the &quot; constructions of concrete &quot; in taunus .
was their &quot; journey the bathing more exceptional of centroeuropa &quot; 13 countries : also of germany , austria and switzerland , visited places of italy , france , the republic czech , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , romania , poland , and a city respectively in luxembourg , serbia and croatia .
this german of 46 years is a real keen of the culture the bathing .
not want have nothing see with the sport , says meder , only the water is different .
only you bother that the sports the bathing have that conformarse with azulejos blue and nostrils to chlorine , while the sports to cause can breathe the fascinating smell of the forests of abetos or listen the alegres trinos of the birds in the park .
&quot; a day i asked what the pools have that be always so feas &quot; , says this head of vienna .
&quot; launched to coleccionar pools fine . &quot;
the surface the water concern the architecture .
the chapoteo in the well and the etéreos meats of the sauna . the factor of welfare in the pools is so large because atienden all the ways , according meder .
and if the complaint striving , the pools covered can be a real gift to the view : &quot; in place of soil , in the bathing has a surface of water . &quot;
&quot; a part is transparent , another part is the beauty of all the building . &quot;
all dobla ópticamente : the highest bóvedas , the azulejos of colours , the trampolines .
the book with photographs in format small &quot; badefreuden &quot; provided in 190 pages data very interesting on the architecture and the history the art in the oasis historical the welfare , but , mainly , is politics of established the blue .
meder , the coleccionista of pools discover the recruits leading in their research in hungary .
bigger to the magníficos bathing medicinales as the bathing of széchenyi of budapest , of 100 years , are the water with oesophagus in a odd cavidad kárstica ( bathing in cavidades in miskolc-tapolca ) , as a termas , whose pools are of water alcalinas and are in a building with way of bottleneck ( városi termálfürdö in jászberény ) .
many pools descubiertas in switzerland and austria are these such : while the the city being the eyes in the well techada of zurich , can look to arlberb , perpetrators of snow , since the well foreign of a bathing in st . antón , and : in the bathing turkish there a window since the can observed the practice in the runs of ski .
the design , time , more exceptional expected to the customers in längenfeld : the cathedral the water of ötztal seems a ovni has of have in the alps .
of three sources open remember vapor in winter , while of fund mountains of ötztal quoting in the sky .
alhambra in the jungle black
to meder , the coleccionista of pools , not you invadía the smell to chlorine in all the pools .
many bathing termales huelen to sulphur , in the bathing of árpád in békescsaba , hungary , the fever to gasóleo is so strong that the people believe have come to a bathing health .
the smell next of the water medicinales contain bicarbonato and álcali and whose légamo pega to the fur into in the well , a that the welfare of a way special .
issue meder also decepcionó in a place in their search of places bonitos to the bathing , when wanted visiting pools descubiertas and bathing of sun in the bathing czech of luhatschowitz , found with a ground blocked .
the bathing of 1902 the architect duan jurkovic was cerrado .
when meder miró to through of the desmoronadas windows the building modernista red , white and yellow , was the bath grow between the azulejos .
the decline contrarrestaba in a well encantadora in the jungle black : the palacio termal in bad wildbald .
these bathing have three phases of construction after of itself ; not only can be elements neorománicos of times of their construction in 1844 , if not also a hall arab of lifestyle alhambra , added in 1900 .
since their esmerada modernisation in 1995 , the palacio termal is the bathing favourite of the coleccionista of pools , issue meder , and not only because be natural of the jungle black .
&quot; has much merit fusionar different lifestyles arquitectónicos in a unit so fantastic &quot; , says meder .
in a palacio it inmersión in the well spa apparently not has a importance .

the threat concreta
after the discovery of &quot; the cell of zwickau &quot; , the media of communication turks dudan the state of right german .
a newspaper about of a &quot; ideology bloody &quot; again to reavivarse .
the mullah of eight small employers grist and greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right .
in turkey and in the population german of origin turkish has reacted with fear and concern to this news .
to many germans of origin turkish returning a fantasma passed dead ago time , since the attacks with way of fires in mölln in november of 1992 and in solingen in may of 1993 , not had happened more episodes of violence with background of extreme right against turks .
not however , never has questioned that in germany there xenophobia .
the network ultraderechista latest reveals a scale whose dimensions not were , or much least , previsibles .
&quot; ¿ again to reavivarse the ideology bloody ? &quot; , titula the edition internet the newspaper turkish &quot; haberturk &quot; .
the newspaper &quot; sabah &quot; resalta the otherwise one of the authors the crime was a informer of the office federal of defence of the constitution and shows concerned that the authorities german can be involved in the pantanal ultraderechista .
the community turkish in germany reaccionó with sensatez , the end of week reminded to the victims of the violence racist with a vigilia to the door of brandenburgo .
two weeks before , the community turkish in berlin with with the politicians german and turks reflexionaron in a act formal the fifty anniversary the agreement turco-alemán .
the them brought in scene with alegres colours , as a history with end happy .
the information was to some media turks as a bofetada : &quot; the gift german the fifty anniversary &quot; , says the title of a article in the platform turkish of internet &quot; sheet x &quot; , give background of the chain of mullah .
the emission german &quot; hürriyet &quot; not should in maintain this connection mental .
&quot; comienza to get &quot; , says the title of the spine of ahmet külahci .
resalta that the asesinados were people pagaban their taxes and did a important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of germany .
in the body of internet of germans of procedencia turkish , the behaviour of the police and their of success in the búsquedas is very accept .
the authors asombran of that the authorities german not have buscado much before further in the circle of the ultraderecha .
no shows as least rhetorical in as to the drásticos media : &quot; to from of now here lose , to the immigrants not them is more that the stun and the arms &quot; .
&quot; this will the best autoprotección &quot; .
&quot; the peace internal of germany depends very of the quality of the abuse and of the finding of the penalty to the the network &quot; . , says &quot; selen &quot; .
what means that , if the peace internal of germany is in danger , the attacks of mölln and solingen aclararán in nineties years .
the image of the ruins the fire of solingen has grabado in the flash german and turkish .
no another skeletons was more clearly to the turks live here that there a threat concrete and , to the germans , the mistrust and the distance can desembocar in the violence .
the attacks agudizan the sense of group of the part turkish .
not repeat the errors the last
in the press turkish reputed then mainly the swathes of the policy german after the attacks , helmut kohl denies to visiting to the survivors of mölln .
after the attack with way of fire of solingen sent a telegrama of condolences president turkish and klaus kinkel , their minister of affairs foreign , sustituyó in the funeral of cologne . kinkel detalló in their speech what contribute with the taxes the turks of germany .
is how estimated the value of a person according the amount of their taxes .
the information current of the media turks again to show what thorough is , since then , the mistrust of many germans of origin turkish in the legality of this country .
also the effort of a explanation wider and of a revaloración the terrorism of extreme right in germany , this time do lack words francas .
the bank the scandal the lake of zurich
the bank more arriesgado of europe not is in italy or france , if not in switzerland .
the ubs almost been in bancarrota in the crisis financial and since then deslizó of a crisis to the next .
now it is a german .
safe that axel weber not had considered .
after of their spectacular starting of the summit the bank federal , in july through in 2013 comenzaría in a new and almost also of spectacular work : president the council administrative the great bank swiss ubs , a inesperado and lucrative step in their career .
axel weber am publicly , commends switzerland their beauty and to the ubs their acquired strength and is fall comments amables on their future colleagues .
&quot; the flash has achieved a revival &quot; .
&quot; i am cooperate with kaspar villiger and oswald grübel &quot; .
in september became clear that all would completely different .
a operators financial of the flash in london prevented all the systems of security the bank and defraudó 1,7 billion million of eur .
oswald grübel , director general of the flash , a banker not only known in switzerland , had that come .
the president the council administrative of the flash was since then also tocado , and all asked : ¿ when is axel weber ?
through weber must advise the bank since february of 2012 .
and will office of the presidency the council administrative in may , not to principles of 2013 , as the bank comunicó the tuesday .
this is choice to axel weber .
not is banker , more well , professor of economy and consejero and has had a period of adjustment surely necessary .
of coup ago responsible of the strategy of a bank , has of return to prove deserves the title &quot; the greater bank the scandal of europe &quot; since ago time .
a part , the flash is huge , to ago little was the greater administrator of goods global , and another part , since ago years , desliza of a scandal next .
nothing , seems , you ahorra the it so proud bank swiss .
started the crisis financial .
the flash had a reputation excellent to 2007 .
the image the administrator of goods swiss discreto and hardest , but also mañoso , combinó with objectives ambitious , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investment .
a part , with 1,6 billion of dollars , the flash managed more money of customers wealthiest that any another bank the world .
and another part , avanzó as bank of investment in the league of the large banks the world .
this impresiona .
hans geiger , the former banker and of professor of banca in zurich for many years is : &quot; to my students , always i described to the flash as model of a good bank . &quot;
&quot; since the point of view current , one asked : ¿ how could equivocarme ? &quot;
was in a great mistake .
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very in the flash .
to in of year , peter wuffli , director general , to then was considered as a banker genial and very intelligent , resigned surprisingly .
some months after , sospechó the reason .
the fund of investment the bank embarcó in losses with titles of high risk and had that amortizar thousands of million .
to should with this , the flash announced a inyección of capital of nothing least of 13 billion million of frf .
to this found investors , course that some miraran with contempt to little before : a fund state asian and opaco of singapore and a fund state arab , so discreto , never had heard their name .
this era only the first coup .
in april of 2008 , empeoró .
the bank had that wage the loss of thousands of million , marcel ospel , president the council administrative , in 2006 in the second better paid council administrative of switzerland , resigned .
in october of 2008 , are the disaster , in view of their investment wrong , the ubs found in the crisis financial to the collapse and had that be rescatada the state .
the bank national compró values problem to the ubs many thousands of million , the confederation helvética was six thousands of million of frf a bono tests converted , by the convertía in copropietaria the bank .
the switzerland was affected , said what dramatic was this to a country small , if aloja to banks so large .
finally the suma the balance of the ubs in 2007 was more of five times greater that the results economic of switzerland ( see gráfica ) .
&quot; not we return to rescue to the ubs &quot; , said geiger , expert in banca .
to the first disaster joined the second .
few months after , the ubs capituló in a conflict fiscal with america and was ready to drawn the data of the customers wealthiest , possibly had defraudado taxes with aid the bank .
also , evaluated a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars , point of profits injustificados of these business with a compensation payment .
with , the ubs confesó more or least have helped in the fraud fiscal .
simultaneously lost something had been since always their capital in the competition customers rich : the aureola of discretion .
after the scandal , the secret the bank swiss already not is the same .
to this continued the lövin the president of the junta directive and the president the council administrative .
and the exodus of the funds of the customers .
of this way , in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central : in the banca of investment by the speculation wrong and in the administration of goods by the aid fraud fiscal .
and just when heard to be something more relaxed , just when i that the ubs heard to that , is this desdichada history the operators , a operators individual defraudó 1,7 billion million of eur , before of that the bank diera account of that something was .
and desveló , what further , this still not works well with the management of risk in the banca of investment .
&quot; with the case adoboli holding that the controls of risk have changed too little &quot; , says martin janssen , professor of economy and finance in the institute bancario of the university of zurich .
the director financial of a great bank german also is safe : &quot; the problem of the ubs is that not dominates the controls of risk &quot; .
what did the idea of the caution , with the the bankers own made since ago time , be the watch of the elderly goods the world : no risk too large , in change , the security the money want quebrar the another hand of the republic alpine .
the deposits of security of the banks own were the symbol of the reliability inquebrantable , as lindt and sprüngli the chocolate genuine .
the central of the ubs in zurich not dovetails with the buzz the hardest bank private swiss , only is a little greater .
the situation is classical .
the bank has their headquarters main in the street bahnhofstraße of zurich , is since the station main directly lake of zurich , enmarcado the summits covered of snow of the mountains suizas .
here the buildings are ostentosos , the housing are one of the more higher of europe .
here are joyerías as tiffany`s between business traditional own as the confitería sprüngli .
here lie since ago years the banks own : since the bank national , happening the palacio of credit suisse , to the elitarios banks private as julius bär .
will in the room of reception of the ubs by a heavy door chair .
within the walls are revestidas of mármol , ahead are large sillones of such , with the logo the bank there a great letrero to indicate the &quot; security &quot; .
the ubs know what the client seeking here : security .
the two large banks own , the ubs and credit suisse , in some time have desplazado the idea the great bank swiss , or it have betrayed , as is the president of a small bank private swiss .
prefer not read their name in the newspaper , the end and out ago , as all the bankers own , also with the business of both banks .
the ubs has done too large , is , mainly in the banca of investment , where the continental have won ground .
the own not had nothing more say .
&quot; and have have for a time to the grip of the continental . &quot;
of done , the ubs changed the banca of investment with , concerned their first great benefits and then was the disaster , no entity financial european had lost therefore money in the jungla the high risk as the great bank swiss .
the 15 of october of 2008 , the disaster was clear .
&quot; that wednesday the coalition government the small country of siete million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &quot; , says the author lukas hässig in their book &quot; de ubs-crash &quot; ( &quot; the crash of the ubs &quot; in spanish ) .
the politicians granted to 68 thousands of million of frf or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur to save the great bank of the bancarrota .
¿ how them happens ?
about with the bankers own , are the problem in the dimension of the ubs .
in june of 1998 , two of the three large banks own fusionan in a poderoso consortium .
arises a bank , because to the merger , was too large to the small switzerland , and is growing .
what was to that the two different banks precursors of the ubs complementaran : a bank wealthy but old with the centre of the administration of goods in zurich and a internacionalización more poor but more strong .
of suddenly , the banks of investment internacionalizados came of way ready with a money , with the were do rodar a great bicycle financial .
there two names about with this increase of the ubs : peter wuffli , head the consortium of the ubs of 2001 to 2007 , and marcel ospel , then president the council administrative .
&quot; always thought that wuffli and ospel were a team perfect &quot; , says the expert in banca hans geiger .
&quot; wuffli , the intellectual , modest , understand much of models and statistics , and ospel , the intuitivo managed open step since the learning in the bank to the summit . &quot;
finally , ospel fió of wuffli .
and the end wuffli was probably a mistake decisive : &quot; was that their models were a reality &quot; , says geiger .
&quot; is a case tragic . &quot;
tragic , perhaps .
is clear : the desatino was before the case .
the employees of the ubs remember clearly of the meetings of superiors , in the wuffli , the head the consortium , always repetía the same motto : come the iv to goldman sachs .
the bank american was the bank of investment more poderoso the world .
encabezaban the &quot; league tables &quot; , the clasificaciones then documentaban the success of the banks .
the ubs wanted be in the summit .
some steps you got well .
in the operations of divisas and in the negotiations of actions was in what more high .
however , the advisers of companies eager put of highlighted a point weak : in the business the interest international , in the language of banca &quot; fixed income &quot; , there a compensation huge to the large banks .
the ubs has vacíos in the products hipotecarios american .
to fill these vacíos , the ubs started a adventure almost you costs their existence .
or of growth , invirtieron therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investment american of high risk .
transformed in a machine powerful to titularizar appropriations hipotecarios american and venderlos to continuation , manteniendo certain risks to account own .
and also , as other banks at the bajada for a time .
&quot; in summer of 2007 , as the market real american was in llamas , the ubs compró there &quot; , said geiger , expert in banca .
so large the euphoria , so thorough the fall .
a workforce had that irse , already the attempt of one was more complicated of what were .
the jobs in the ubs became in seats proyectables and are inseguros to the today .
currently , who is a great bank , has a work almost impossible .
must find a strategy to a bank , to the all the models of business lógicos are stumbling .
geiger , expert in banks , has a idea , put end to the banca of investment , focus in the administration of goods , return to the roots suizas .
the bank not want come so far ( still ) .
but the banca of investment must decrease much , is clear currently .
the next thursday , sergio ermotti , the new president the bank , will their future strategy world .
in reality , only was in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a solution transitional , already the bank the bank separó surprisingly of their predecessor grübel .
meanwhile , he imposed : must be of way permanent the business of the ubs , comunicó the bank of zurich the tuesday .
ermotti want restore the bank of investment to their state to in of the nineties .
suprime 3.500 jobs .
but this not is .
the ubs needs a vision .
¿ who is ?
¿ with what want win money ?
these are the questions secure ago axel weber currently .
to the time only says that first buscará a housing with their woman in zurich .
the next year .

massacre to level personal
the strong and generous new book of peter englund , the beauty and the pain of the battle ( the beauty and the sorrow ) : a history íntima about of the first war world , &quot; begins with a long dramatis personae the kind can do that to one you caiga the soul to the feet .
i here some by of action : testing suavemente this website and conviértala in their mark pages .
will to know very well to these people in the narración novelística the mr englund , and this dramatis personae will as their gps , a faro for these few at in the , as one of their men and women , is and desamparado in the fog of the war .
the mr englund is a judt and journalist swedish .
also is the new secretary permanent of the academy sueca , granted the prize nobel of literature .
what has written here is a book little corriente , describes , rightly , as &quot; a work of anti-historia &quot; .
contains some names significant , treaties important or frugal battles ; virtually not there ambassadors , elegant journalists or discussions on tácticas or material .
not is therefore a book about of what happened , is , as &quot; a book about of how happened &quot; . is about of &quot; feelings , fingerprints , experiences and states of humour &quot; .
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; being the experiences in times of war of more or least 20 men and women ordinarias , to both both of the war , since colegialas and botánicos to escaladores , doctors , drivers of stab and administrative .
some of these people convertirán in heroes .
some convertirán in prisoners of war , or will their member , might locos or morirán .
their lives parpadean here as velas votivas encendidas in a church ; a new add to the while others go .
the book the mr englund is a handicap of the books of history standard .
is also a correctivo to the notion of that the first war world only was the funesta war of trincheras in the operating western .
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; seeing of way skilled to through of other teatros of war : the alps , the balkans , the operating eastern , mesopotamia , africa the east .
to the soldiers in this book them give above the colmenas ; one is the christmas in egypt under the pirámides ; the sledgehammer tse-tse are a problem intratable .
this is a book conmovedor , almost since the start .
the war inunda the lives of these people as a disaster natural , a hurricane katrina apesta to cordita .
when the ceasefire of artillery hear in the distance , and replied a woman is in home with tus children , ¿ you quedas or huyes ?
of all forms ¿ who next ?
almost nobody understand what is happening , or even what has that fight this war .
&quot; we of facts &quot; , is the mr englund , &quot; has rellenado with conjeturas , suposiciones , hopes , scares , ideas fixed , theories of the conspiración , dreams , pesadillas and rumours &quot; .
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; is to individuals as florence farmborough , a juliet available in the army russian , and richard stumpf , a young marinero german of the fleet of high sea .
their stories have obtained in their greater part of flash , letters and another material already published previously .
the explanations of their lives can be aterradoras or conmovedoras , but are more available of life in the accumulation of small at , details stumbling , the mr englund .
many of these are about of privaciones and of ashgabat with what there .
acerca of have the history of a colegiala german says : &quot; sucedáneos , all parties sucedáneos &quot; .
&quot; sucedáneo of coffee , hypermarkets untrue , plastic of imitation , vendas of role , botones of wood . &quot;
continues talking of the food sucedánea in germany .
describes &quot; meat pale to from of rice cocido and prensado in blubber of carnero ( and rematado with a hueso untrue has of wood ) ; tobacco has of roots and peladuras of potatoes dry ; shoes with suelas of wood &quot; .
there , is , &quot; 837 substitutes permitidos of the meat in the production of salchichas , 511 substitutes the coffee registered &quot; .
some stories are about the honour and the value .
a american recognised their own momentum to the assemblies and a about of the war : &quot; sientes , after of all , this is to what the men are designed and not to sit in sillones with a cigarro and a aquavit , the newspaper of the afternoon or a best seller , and removing that that paints means civilisation and that not there a barbarian behind of pechera almidonada and tachonada . &quot;
in change a soldier british is account of that probably morirá , and of that nobody enterará or you importará .
&quot; a time one resigna the thought of sacrificarse , to one you like think that could happens ahead the public &quot; , says .
in change , is horriblemente reminiscent &quot; to a condemned being estrangulado in secret &quot; .
other comments are about of a old europe builds , and about of new types of terror .
&quot; the conflict has become every time more in a competition economic &quot; , says the mr englund , &quot; a war between factories &quot; .
is the arrival of what he is &quot; a new kind in the bestiario the young century : the murderer in mass elocuente and convinced ideológicamente with ropas of good textiles executes their fighters while is clear behind of a escritorio &quot; .
the people means of ways imprevistas ; there therefore behaviour innoble as heroico .
the mr englund about of the soldiers us actively catch a disease venérea of prostitutes as way of evade the service in the operating .
&quot; the expression more redeeming of this can see the trade of state gonocócico , the soldiers buy and embadurnan with their genitales with the hope of end in the hospital &quot; , says .
&quot; those are truly desperate what frotan on their eyes , what to often is place to a ceguera of life . &quot;
in this translation the swedish pale peter graves , the prosa the mr englund ágil but not extravagante , is perfectly adaptada to their task human .
in dozens of small scenes is the way in the the war to &quot; gazan forces excepcionalmente incontrolables : nationalism far , revolution social , hatred religious &quot; .
the people starts to ask what their leaders them are doing combat .
the best books about of the first war world to often have been indirectos , as the britain war and the memory modern of paul fussell , or novelas as odysseus in the operating of erich maría remarque , in time of stories integrales .
the volume the mr englund unite to a countryman little conventional .
their book has one of the end more devastating that can remember in a labour of not fiction .
not revelaré .
but is as if would come since their book , arrancado of between your attitudes website of dramatis personae , and it would planted with a cerilla .

the union of workers of support demandará to the city the redundancies
the union represents to hundreds of workers of support school lost their jobs the month last planning exceeding to the city the wednesday , say that the redundancies were unnecessary and discriminatory because to their impact desproporcionado on the schools atienden to students poor .
the demand is , possibly , the last weapon to available the union , the district municipal 37 , in their effort revocar the redundancies .
seiscientos seventy and two vacancies of the school , the coordinators of parents and other employees were between the worst paid of the city lost their work the 7 of october , in a movement the leaders trade have referred as a venganza political their cost to allow , the spring last , the access part of the city to a fund of assistance health to office of groups of work to close their gap budgetary .
the authorities municipal have denied categorically prosecution .
in a hearing in the city the month last , the consejero of education , ross m. walcott , said that the redundancies were a part the budget completely in june .
a member the council contraatacó understood that nothing in the budget especificaba that the member the staff of support of the school would despedidos .
officials the district municipal 37 said that tabled the complaint writing , advirtiendo at department of education of that would demanded . will a conference of press the wednesday to announce the presentation official of the demand , in the court supreme state in manhattan .
the demand include the sr. walcott and department of education of the city as accused , and has with eight workers despedidos as demandantes , all them women blackest or latinas , the as that the majority of the assistants lost their jobs .
elizabeth case , spokesman the department legal of the city , said that the city not had seen the demand and what therefore not could do comments on their claims specific .
according a draft of the demand agonising the new york times , the union has focused in the number of redundancies in the schools of areas poor of the city to support a complaint treatment unfair , saying that the schools poor lost more assistants , already had been insuficientemente receive of is risk .
that if well not there redundancies in staten island and a few redundancies in the schools in the upper dundalk side or tribeca , 17 assistants school lost their jobs in the district 23 in brownsville , brooklyn , and 46 were dismissed in the districts 8 and 9 in the south the bronx .
taking in account the loss of five of the eight assistants used the school public 36 in harlem , where the 68 cent of the students live in the poverty , the demand says , &quot; this not is a area of parents wealthiest be have funds to cover the deficit budgetary &quot; .
p.d. the budget the district 36 reduced in a 3,26 cent this year , and also lost money when the city changed the way in estimated the funding additional to every abolition student poor in the schools .
the union also says that the directors of schools imperative can have been engañados the language in a memorándum authorises the employees of the coordinators of parents .
the memorándum dispense the word &quot; surplus &quot; to prescribed the action , to despite of &quot; surplus &quot; describes with greater often the act of transfer to a proxy of the nómina of a school to a exchange of work , whose increases are paid the office central .
&quot; sixty and six coordinators of parents were dismissed &quot; , says the draft of the complaint , &quot; and not only in surplus &quot; .
mission right , the congress prepared to come to a agreement on libya
seems that finally republican and demócratas in the capitolio are ready to country of agreement on something related with the embargo in libya .
all what needed was that the rebellion had success , the veterano dictator muamar the gaddafi would just and reverse and the participation of states united was to their end .
the tuesday , the committee of affairs foreign the senate is to be a resolution , patrocinada the president john kerry ( democrat massachusetts ) , with with the senadores john mccain ( republicano arizona ) and joseph i. lieberman ( independent connecticut ) , aplaudiendo to the libyans their successful rebellion and to the troops of ee.uu. their &quot; courage &quot; .
&quot; this resolution is to honrar to the valientes of libya , the start to rebuild their country &quot; , said kerry .
&quot; is a claim of support bipartidista to their aspirations democratic . &quot;
the language can appear inofensivo , but nothing on the debate on libya has been easy to now .
this summer , the legislators of both parties peleaban between itself and with the home white on the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the military of ee.uu. in the mission of the nato in libya .
in june , kerry and mccain tabled a resolution authorises the use limited of forces military of ee.uu. in libya .
the project of law was derrotado in the house a broader margin bipartidista , and that never was to votarse in the senate .
but the same day in the project of law was rejected in the house , the house also rejected a measure would recortado the funds to the operations american in libya .
what he the mission of ee.uu. in a kind of purgatorio legislative - with the congress enough upsetting as to criticise the within part of obama of the mission , but not so enfadado as to in reality segar the hierba under their feet .
to continuation , the indecisión the congress was superada the events .
trípoli fell in hands of the rebels libios in august , and gaddafi was murdered the 20 of october .
the mission of the nato was officially the 31 of october .
now the senate could be group to act .
the resolution the committee of affairs foreign &quot; welcomes the people of libya their tremendo courage and extraordinary resistance to shake to itself same &quot; and &quot; commends to the men and women of the forces armadas of states united and to their partners of the coalition took in operations military to protect at people of libya their extraordinary courage and professionalism &quot; .
the resolution also &quot; states the interest national of the states united in one successful and irreversible transition to the democracy in libya . &quot;
¿ are the new measure the complete support of the commission of affairs foreign , or dividirá to the legislators as was the project of law of june ?
the last version was rejected the senator richard g. place ( indiana ) , the main republicano the committee .
the spokesman of place said the monday that not had seen still the version final the new project of law .
the another hand the capitolio , the house is to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget employee , a priority legislative to almost all the congresistas republican and some democrats .
the measure , patrocinada the republicano bob goodlatte ( republicano virginia ) , will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another issue of fact logre a vote of the the house in the house or the senate in this congress .
others legislators not have had success to the time to do come their amendments to the house , but not lack of attempts .
the of goodlatte is only a of the 68 amendments constitutional have taken in this congress , abarcan a wider range of subjects .
some are duplicados - the same project of law proposes therefore in the house as in the senate - and others with small shift between itself .
there what least 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the house , and another handful &quot; be the expenditure federal . &quot;
some of these projects of law also are idénticos between itself , but are to their patrocinadores - on all republican job are refinar their currículums - the opportunity of jactarse of that them were the &quot; authors &quot; of that measure .
the law of control of budget , was approved in august , requirió that therefore the house as the senate had a amendment the balance budgetary .
in march , 58 senadores voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of amendment .
more beyond the budget , several member want limit the number of mandatos the member the congress can comply , while the representative josé e. serrano ( democrat new york ) , want denied the limit of two mandatos to the presidents .
the representative jesse l. jackson jr . ( democrat illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments ensure the right to a education of quality and attention health , between other subjects .
a amendment prohibits the marriage homosexual is a proposal perenne , as a prohibits the burning of flags .
some legislators also want allow the annulment of the laws federal if are been two thirds of the states .
so enthusiasts have been the member to the time of propose amendments , not are pulling to a pace more rapid that in years previous .
in the 111º congress , the legislators participating 77 amendments , and tabled 66 in the 110º .
the pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the the of 1990 , when the member made regularly more of 150 amendments every two years , that figures proporcionadas the library the senate .
but not had much more success then of what have now .
the last amendment added - the 27 - was resting in 1992 , but of done was proposal the congress in 1789 .

the issue is a issue very sensitive to the leaders military , not want appear desagradecidos or in disagreement with the public the serve .
also are account of that the ira to the enfrentaron the troops were in the last years of the war of vietnam was much worst .
as result , the majority of the discussions on the lástima have to out in silence and in private between the veteranos of war .
after of that their two children were of combat with the infantería of marina , the colonel retirado mark cancian them warned of that the people apart of the military considered their service since two prospects .
some them mirarían with a sense of fear because to enfrentaron to the insurgents and they to places exóticos .
others preguntarían if would a &quot; veterano enojado and as below of the surface &quot; , said cancian , fought in iraq and came to a work of high level the government in washington .
for their search of employment , said , felt that some entrevistadores you had was sutilmente if would capable of aguantar under the pressure of a challenging work of washington immediately after of their about of combat .
&quot; when hablas about of your service , necesitas do with to the fingerprints negative &quot; , reminded cancian contándoselo to their children .
arises the concern military , in part , of the indifference us to the wars .
the achievements in the field of battle are rarely time elected to the alabanza part of a country has little familiaridad with the military and is few profits direct of the wars of iraq and afghanistan .
&quot; us , as nation , already not value the heroísmo military of ways were the all common in the second war world &quot; , said the deputy general retirado david barno , who comandó the troops of ee.uu. in afghanistan .
in change , the praise of the politicians and the public concentrate in great measure in the depth the suffering of a member the service .
the troops are reconocidas the number of giras have soportado , the number of friends have lost or the reach of their injury .
the army afronta a growing pressure to end with the violation
this week , a hearing historic decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army their hypothetical passivity to the violation .
if not , hundreds of advice are organising to the next .
the soldier of first elizabeth lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy it night in the she says that was raped a area .
was october of 2008 , and respected of return to their barracks in the basis air miramar , at north of st garcia , after of the dinner with a friend when found with a colleague was a package of 12 latas of beer .
he you asked if could joining to she in their room to take a cup .
&quot; sonó a signal of alarm &quot; , says lyman .
however , the nativa of texas he to a hand their concern .
thought , not , has 19 .
&quot; is of texas &quot; , says .
&quot; running would heard to my enjoyment . &quot;
to the few minutes of into in the room of lyman , the man you acercó behind , tirándola to from and violándola , does .
this week , the 18 of november , lyman and other 27 member the personal military current and old expect ansiosamente a decision legal in a trial historic will in arlington , virginia , decide if the demand have interpuesta against the exsecretario of defence robert philips and their predecessor , donald rumsfeld , fare to trial .
the demand does that philips and rumsfeld top in the reduction of the violation widespread between the military , in violation of the rights constitutional of the soldiers .
such in february susan burke , a immigrés of washington , d.c. , the demand discussed initially to 17 advice , but creció to 28 in the months as , 25 women and three men , all them claim that were violados or agredidos sexually their colleagues , and that the army owned to the time of investigate , try , or provide justice appropriate after of the supuestas violations .
burke says that is to the flat greater the army , because the problem begins with them .
&quot; the army is a structure of down to from &quot; , says .
&quot; ¿ who are the people are in conditions of eradicate the culture of the represalias ? the high control . &quot;
burke also says that since february , have since in contact with she closely of 400 survivors more , many of the which could be part of future demands .
their strategy : in place of earned to all the advice in this case , abide all the eggs in a same basket , were , is to present several cases , of be necessary , to keep the pressure .
the team of the defence to the department of defence , encabezado the prosecutor federal neil macbride , has have a motion to underestimating the case .
the documents the court , bad newsweek , detailing the strategy of defence -en essence , the military not can be demandados soldiers current or old the injury exalted in the forces armed .
a judgment the court supreme of 1950 called the announcement feres , the government federal not is responsible the damage sufridos the staff in service active .
&quot; the damage alegados are part the service military of the advice &quot; , say the documents .
the department of defence refused to do comments to this article .
the things have changed since the years 50 .
while to the women still them is officially outside serve in combat , this distinction is only in : the wars modern rarely time have clear the lines the with .
therefore in iraq as in afghanistan , the equipment of women soldier are desempeñando papers every time more important , especially to come to the women local in areas of war .
the result : between these two wars , 150 women soldier have combination and two thirds of them in situations of combat .
is time of that the army also modernice , says burke .
she not is single in their fight , and other three demands are in , also the their .
in the faculty of right of yale , the clinic of services legal to veteranos is preparing a case against the four main academies military supposed promote a environment misógino .
another part , the organisation mind of profit vietnam veterans of america is drawing a demand against the army focuses in the verdicts of &quot; nuisance of the status &quot; less to the victims of violation with the end of them the high the service -un skeletons common , according the activists , as anu bhagwati of the network of action of women in service , a group of rights human .
their group presented a demand in december against the administration of veteranos , acusándola of practices young in the way in expose the complaints of profits to the people say have been agredidas sexually in the service .
have have nine projects of law separate in the congress part of a bipartidista of senadores and representatives , proposing a series of corrections .
in 2010 there 3.158 violations sexual denunciadas , according the office to the prevention of the aggression sexual and answer the department of defence .
however , the violations are contribution infra denunciadas , and the own estimates the pentagon , figure in approximately the 13,5 cent of the 19000 incidents ladies there that year .
the report , published in march , also considering the nation of prosecution : in 2010 , a 20 cent of the cases denunciados in the army was to trial - the half in the system of justice civil .
the advice in the case of burke , describen their attacks as only the first of a series of mercenaries .
in the case of lyman , deplored the presunta violation to the police military least of a time after of that ocurriera .
night , says , you asked that contara the details of their violation 11 times different to a a of police , doctors , and staff .
she concluded to a kit of violation , and the blood of their agresor -de a court in their brazo- was discovered in their bed .
six months after , in april of 2009 , lyman saw to a hearing to a judge , for the which you asked about of that would had relations sexual with their novio the day the attack .
six people allowed as witnessing of status in name the alleged author , was finally absuelto .
&quot; remember the day in read the verdict &quot; , says lyman .
&quot; thought that i was to go the work -me found shouting since the room . &quot;
&quot; i put in the unit of psiquiatría , and when i , remember that you said to my officer of control , &quot; &quot; that not was their trial . that was my trial &quot; .
to lyman you issued visiting to a psiquiatra military , finally you malnourished a nuisance of the status , what it was not apta to the service .
in january of 2010 was dispensada the service under terms menos-que-honorables , what you prevents receive any benefit .
in as to if the case concrete lyman and their colleagues of demand continues , is a possibility very popular , says john turley , professor of right in the faculty of right orwell washington .
however , , &quot; in my opinion , should be able of continue forward &quot; .
what interpone between them and a verdict is this announcement has been criticada since that published first time .
i been a crítico permanent of the announcement feres .
the army is decades behind because not has the same incentive and deterrent with the responsibility .
and adds : &quot; the degree are very in against of them ... but is important to them forefront . &quot;
these things only period when the people good is ready to fight .
if the hearing not is their way , burke , immigrés of the advice , will to the eu to their other hundreds of advice to cases future .
&quot; we to continue fighting against the army in this issue to that the reform would &quot; , says .
&quot; or to that we muramos , what happen first .
the walls have eyes : how the researchers you are looking in facebook
before of become in the new face of the extreme right in europe , anders behring breivik was simply another kind aireaba their points of view anti-inmigración in line .
the monday , breivik , who befriended have been a killing in norway in july , he 77 dead , faced to their first hearing legal public .
while breivik can have been only , was far of be only in the ciberespacio : had happened the greater part the time preceded to their attack with to their computer , charlando with some of the million of nationalists support to the groups of right in networks social .
after of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people .
but , ¿ how encontrarlas ?
easy - only have that into in facebook .
&quot; we we account of that not was so difficult come to them &quot; , says jamie bartlett , author main of a report published recently on the populism digital european the centre of studies british demos .
the alijo of information personal of facebook is so enciclopédico , says bartlett , the researchers could simply use it tool of advertising to determine their characteristics demográficas deseadas with a precision scientific - the way sellers have been being for years .
the team of bartlett found half million of fan of the groups of right in the europe and then them dirigieron announcements , but in place of vincularles to a new broadband or product of dieta , the announcements invitaban to the users to complete a survey he on their level educational , attitudes to the violence and the optimism on their own future .
the come to through of facebook , bartlett and their colleagues were able of look to more of 10.000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries european - all get of the office .
&quot; is a way completely new of do a research &quot; , says bartlett .
some of the results not are the all surprising : the who in line of the groups of right tend to be young , men and enfadados the immigration .
however , in a kind of drawing , &quot; those combined their activismo in line with the activismo outside of line are more reasonable , more democratic and least violent those are behind of the screen the computer &quot; .
the work of demos is only a example of how facebook is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists .
centres of research , researchers medical and scientists politicians are being the website to look all , since problems of health to trends social as express in the &quot; i like &quot; , messages in the walls and dialogues of state .
with more of 800 million of users active agregando a average of three parts of content day , the &quot; supernova of data &quot; of facebook is target a on of the research , pushing the number of jobs academics with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years .
to some researchers , the beauty of facebook is that you allows look to the people to the not podías acercarte with a carpeta in the street .
&quot; before , when intentabas encuestar to people the party national british , was very difficult identificarlos . &quot;
&quot; tendrías go to through the party , and them never you bring the access &quot; , says bartlett .
&quot; facebook see all that - are to them directly . &quot;
others say that the website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of salud-social .
a study recent out the doctora megan seaside , of the university of wisconsin-madison and their colleagues , found that the students university spoke of their hazañas of borrachera in facebook had a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink the students refused in silence on the issue .
seaside suggests that the colleagues of the students , such as the dispatches residenciales , could control the website and intervene to help to a student expecting too dialogues of state with their table .
&quot; not saying try a problem if not saying diagnosticar &quot; , said dostoevsky christakis , the co-autor of seaside and director the centre of health , behaviour and development the child in the institute of research infantil of seattle , said the washington post .
&quot; have found a way of identify children in risk of another way not would diagnosticados . &quot;
facebook also is constantly &quot; pinchando &quot; to their own population to obtain data .
the team of data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of st valentine , the expectation of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of happiness national ( mainly being the information to the can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago a time maintain that the website should put to available of other their great amount of data to the research ) .
however , the users of facebook know that the website them is watching , them whether or not - the sacrificio be playing the scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website mine your information personal .
but ¿ what is when the users of facebook spend to be part of a survey or even know ?
while the researchers have guidelines well more on how up their data outside of line , in line is a barra free to all .
&quot; not i that many of the users have considered even in the fact of that a researchers could be examining their profiles &quot; , says neil selwyn , a sociologist the laboratory of knowledge of london , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of facebook of students .
&quot; in what to them give , was only between them and their friends . &quot;
then is the question of the methodology .
even outside of line , not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest .
in facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the wall are truth .
&quot; what dices in facebook and what described outside of facebook are two things completely different &quot; , says selwyn .
is that that , to despite of their years as researchers of the technology , selwyn believe that a sujetapapeles and a bolígrafo are being the best tools of research that nobody can use .
&quot; not there sustituto to into in the world real and speak with the people real &quot; , says .
&quot; the research social is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line . &quot;
&quot; cold and inhuman : anders behring breivik ago their first emergence public in the court
anders behring breivik , the man confesó be the brain of the two attacks killed to 77 people in norway this summer , has referred to itself same as a combatiente of the &quot; resistance &quot; for their first emergence public in the court of oslo .
&quot; i a commander military in the movement of resistance norwegian and in the gentlemen templarios of norway &quot; , said to a room full with 500 people .
&quot; i am the court , already received the mandate of the organisations support the ideology the hatred and because supports the multiculturalismo . &quot;
&quot; i the facts but not i adjourned guilty . &quot;
the judge torkjel nesheim was to breivik for that monólogo , because &quot; not wanted give to breivik the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform to that exprese their points of view &quot; .
the same reason refused to allow to breivik , brought a speech writing with early , invited to the relatives of their victims the end of the hearing .
nesheim also issued to the police keep to breivik under custody for 12 weeks more , you banned the access to the media of communication for four weeks , and said that the authorities should that have a narrower control on all the visits and the correspondencia for eight weeks .
around of 30 survivors and relatives of the victims were to the hearing .
some came with the hope of look to breivik to the eyes , others to confirm that is recluido under key .
all were with the aim of move to the conclusion .
&quot; thought that seemed cold and inhuman &quot; , said a superviviente of utoya to the outlet noruega nrk .
&quot; was awkward , but to me was a step forward after of see and hear to using . &quot;
reasonable with a suit dark and shirt blue , breivik remained calmado and professional to what long of the hearing and miró to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when been and went the building .
to despite of the strange notion of breivik of be part of a movement of &quot; resistance &quot; greater , the judge determinó that not is a country mental , and said that not there evidence of that act with cómplices .
is possible that to some them consuele that the attacks the 22 of july realise be labour of a extremista in place of a group of way .
but that not suaviza automatically the pain and the confusion that the a nation still feel .
&quot; i like that man a monster , but not seems &quot; , said a family of a victim .
&quot; would much more easy if what man . &quot;
7 lessons of the interview up of steve jobs , are in a theatre this week
after the death of steve jobs , the 5 of october , there some what compararon with henry ford - distinguiendo at genie of the technology as the britain inventor moderno .
but what the fan of apple could find more demonstrates , in a interview to jobs recently redescubierta to the has desempolvado as train of a series of proyecciones special in the elderly markets this week , is how had this mind creativa about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products .
was doubt a leather , soñador and hippie autorreconocido , but also was a inflated meticuloso and a yonki of the diagramas of flow - a man passed that many place sufrían &quot; a disease is in think that a great idea is the 90 cent the work ... &#91; but &#93; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product . &quot;
in 1995 , bob cringely was developing the series of television the triumph of the nerds ( the triunfo of the idiotas ) on the albores the computer personal , and sit for more of a time with jobs to a can and rarely conversation .
in that time had happened barely 10 years since that jobs had been forced to marcharse of apple , and already working hard in their new company informática next , waiting the adoption popular of internet .
while a small part of the interview of cringely used in nerds , said that the original of the interview dissolved for their transport .
was only after of the death of jobs found a copy full in vhs in the philips the director .
this material of inquiries , slightly reeditado , is the basis of steve jobs : the interview up , of 68 minutes , that is to the cines landmark this wednesday and thursday .
to someone known odiar the interviews in depth , jobs here seems surprisingly ready to run their philosophies tecnológicas and strategies trade .
and very pensativo .
in four points different to what long of the interview , there large silencios between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of reflexiones , where jobs is sopesando clearly their thoughts , for precision .
also there at in the the perfeccionismo of jobs control to the surface , where seems impaciente because to the questions of cringely , empujándole to go more rápido to the subjects or arguments of greater importance .
filmado before of the era of pixar , the ipod or the iphone , there something extrañamente profético in the interview up , when jobs evalúa what is that other companies do well and , and offers their own vision the future of the conclusion .
a thing is read assessments póstumas of the career of jobs , but there something crude and inspirador in the jobs that see here , the soñador ansioso on of the greatness .
he has a vision of as can and must be the things .
not much after of explicarlo all with detail here , was and was .
a rapid short of seven secuencias significant of the interview up :
on how aprendió to carry a business :
&quot; to what long of the years in the business , i always he : &quot; &quot; ¿ what described things ? &quot; and the answers that you are of way invariable are : &quot; oh , that is only the way as ago &quot; .
nobody know what ago what ago , in the business nobody think in the things very deeply .
that is what found .
jobs has the detail their efforts to simplify the accounting of apple .
desconcertado the way in registraban the costs - to often beginning with a &quot; cost standard &quot; was to eye of good cubero , and that then make with a &quot; one &quot; - developed a factory automatizada aseguraba that could determine the costs trade detail .
on the joke the pope :
jobs narra the &quot; box blue &quot; he same was with steve wozniak - a recording did to the people hackear effectively the company telephone and do llamadas to long distance free .
has written widely about the recording , but the euphoria of jobs here the prescribed the box blue as a act of empoderamiento is contagioso .
describes how he and wozniak probaron the box by the use of a telephone public , doing a call , and then conectándose since a network of at &amp; ts to one , while creaba a bucle with the greater amount of satellite possible .
&quot; were envolviendo the things around the world a average dozen of times and gritabas to through the telephone public and heard a minute more later telephone public of the door of the hand &quot; , says jobs with a risita .
&quot; we people and what did was that cannot build something us ourselves could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world . &quot;
us two , not knew much , but cannot build a thing small could control a thing giant - was a lesson incredible , and not i that never would been apple she .
jobs continues describiendo a joke gloriosa he and wozniak almost kept , llamando vatican to through of the box blue in half of the night and requesting speak with the pope , while was their best imitation of henry kissinger .
to measure that several member of the hierarchy catholic were convocados in half of the night to speak with the diplomatic us , the two estallaron in carcajadas just before of that the mismísimo pope would reawakened to go to answer the telephone .
on enamorarse of the technology ( and the sale telephone with philips hewlett ) :
to the age of 12 years , to the hunting of parts of spare to build a contador of often , at to philips hewlett in the guide telephone and you was a call .
little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes , jobs managed a employment of summer to time this in hewlett-packard .
&quot; that was a remarkable influence on me , was the only company had seen to age and formed my vision of what was a company and well that trataban to their employees . &quot;
jobs became after in one of the employees of hp that they the laboratories of research of the company in palo high , where was &quot; the first computer of table never has &quot; .
was so large as a sprinkler , had a small screen of tubo catódico , and i enamoré of he .
conseguiría a journey to hp as girl and lose the time with machine and escribiría programmes to she .
on improvisar the innovation :
in several points of the interview , jobs about about of reinvent new products on the .
soon in their career , already dedicated to sell a handful of numberplates basis , you asked a client if could did all the team .
working with only 30 days of credit , had that abused the montaje and the over of the equipment acabados .
more later , while was in apple , reminds the earlier to the faced in the development of a ratón of computer :
&quot; i agreement of have arguments dramatic ... i gritaban that be five years &#91; to create a ratón costaría 300 dollars &#93; , and i harté and i i outside and found a leather .
noventa days after , had a ratón cannot build 15 dollars and was completely reliable .
on the large companies losing force :
much before of that liderara the you of apple , jobs proféticamente foresaw the way in that many leaders of the industry tropezarían in their vision , and perderían the control of their share of market .
&quot; di trabajas in ibm or xerox , what described fotocopiadoras and impresoras best , ¿ and what ? &quot;
you has the monopoly of the share of market , what the company not has more success .
the departments of sales and marketing increase the success , what are this class of people the end be companies and the people spreading of the products are expulsadas the forum to the process of decisions .
the genie of the products was to position of monopoly pudre fault of people not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge the profession necessary .
that is what happened in xerox ...
xerox could have adueñado of the the industry informática .
could have been ten times their size , could have been the microsoft of the years 90 ...
were the defeat of the victory .
on the innovation as expression artistic :
&quot; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... to measure evoluciona the great idea , change and overall . &quot;
learns much about of the sutilezas of the same .
there sacrifices have that do - some things not saying do that do the electrones , the glass ago , the robots do , the factories do .
have that keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - ajustarlos all to the time ...
the final all reduces will - rebaja to try exponerte to what best a team of human has done , and then try of adjust these things to the your you doing .
pablo said that the good artists copied , the large artists roban .
never have had shame about of steal large ideas .
what in part was large the macintosh was that the people were working in he were musicians , poetas , artists , zoólogos , historians , incidentally were the best scientists fundamental the world .
if not would the conclusion , could be doing things maravillosas in other camps .
scalia and case cenan with the rivales of the law of assistance health while the court accept the case
the day the court by met to door closed to look the question politically controversial of if aceptarían the challenge to the law of assistance health the president obama , two of their officers , antonin scalia and clarence case , were agasajados in a dinner patrocinada the signing of lawyers expondrá the case to the high court .
the occasion was the last thursday , when the nine judges met in a hearing preliminary to look which the petitions of review .
one of the cases in question was a demand such 26 states seized the reform total of the assistance health adopted the congress the year last , a law has been a out of war to the activists conservative in all the country .
the officers acordaron admit to exercise the demand and , of fact , expected a plea historic of 5 hours and average to march , and the result probably enturbiará still more the career presidential of 2012 , will in full back in the time in the decision the court knows .
the lawyer comparecerá to the court and alegará that the law must be desechada will probably paul clement , who was as prosecutor general of ee.uu. for the government of orwell w. bush .
the signing of lawyers of clement , bancroft pllc , was one of the almost two dozens of companies ayudaron to patrocinar the dinner annual of the society federalista , a group has many years dedicated to the defence of the principles legal conservative .
another signing patrocinó the dinner , jones day , represents to one of the associations trade desafió the law , the federation national of business aura .
another patrocinador was the gigante farmacéutico pfizer inc . , that has a huge interest financial in the result the dispute .
the dinner took in a hotel of washington , hours after of the hearing preliminary the court on the case .
between the assistants was , between others , mitch mcconnell , the republicano more important in the senate and a opponent undeclared of the law of assistance health .
¿ the invited special in the dinner ? scalia and case .
not is nothing new : the two judges have been witnessing to events of the society federal for years .
and not is something take in conflict with the rules ethical .
of done , the judges are exentos the code of behaviour applied the actions of the officers federal lower .
if not recognised , could said that caerían under the code canon 4c , says : &quot; a judge can attend to events to have funds of organisations relating with the law and others , although the judge not can be a speaker , a invitado of honour , or put in the programme of event . &quot;
however , the proximidad absolute of scalia and case to two of the bufetes of lawyers in the case , as to a company with a huge interest financial , was enough to alarmar to the activists of ethics in the government .
&quot; this impressive gap of the ethics and indifference to the code is in against of the demands of several officers playing the court the same rules apply to all the judges federal &quot; , said bob morin , the president of common cause ( cause common ) .
&quot; the judges were agasajados in a revenues of funds of and with lawyers have cases outstanding to the court . &quot;
their emergence and assistance in the revenues of funds to this event socava any demand of sucrose , and is unacceptable .
scalia and case have shown little interest the criticisms say that mezclan too easily the activity the court with the agenda impulsada groups as the society federalista .
and the wife of case , ginni , is a by already conservative .
another part , the conservatives argue that is the magistrada widow kagan , the has a problem ethical , not scalia and case .
kagan worked as procuradora general of the administration obama when tabled the first challenges legal to the law in the court of first instance .
their critics have put to that kagan renewing of see the case , saying that was too involucrada in defend the law as to now be neutral .
kagan not has given no indication of that will to do .

&quot; a cut so large , implemented of this way indiscriminada , would that the greater part of our projects naval and of construction not be plans - not can buy three cuartas parties of a ship or a building - and damage seriously other efforts of modernisation &quot; , wrote panetta to the senadores .
&quot; also we veríamos forced to apartar to many of our officials civil of way involuntaria and , because to that the reduction impondría with so quickly , is almost safe that we that licenciar civil with the end of comply the aim . &quot;
&quot; these changes romperían the faith with those are our army and dañarían seriously the good available . &quot;

&quot; is a tiger of role , a army of cuarteles , buildings and bombs sufficient soldiers public to comply the mission &quot; , said panetta in their words of openness in the pentagon .
&quot; is a force suffering the lower moral , the preparation inadequate and not is capable of chips day with the potential adversaries . &quot;
&quot; in effect , foot to the aggression ... &quot;

as detect a lie
a issue to the headlines more recent we could med serious and curse are the deception and the lie in the life daily .
the candidate presidential republicano herman cain is occupied intercambiando accusations of harassment sexual with several women ; every part accused of lie to the one .
the administrators of the university state of pennsylvania have been being of perjurio supposed conceal reports were that a you of football retirado was agrediendo sexually to children .
the week last , the president french , santa sarkozy , was &quot; pillado &quot; with a microphone open saying president of ee.uu. , barack obama , the first minister israeli benjamin netanyahu is a weak .
lie has destroyed things and convulsionado countries .
the congresista new york and exhibicionista in internet , anthony weiner , was the ourselves with their desmentidos quickly rebatidos the test irrefutable .
the former candidate presidential john edwards has been accused of breaches in the funding of the campaign relating with the encubrimiento of a relationship extramatrimonial .
and , of new , nobody viviera olvidará never the circus mediático gazan the president philips clinton the lie for their second mandate about of their relationship sexual with mónica lewinsky .
are very extendidas the myths on the traps in the examinations of the school and the university .
have given cases in the the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students with the end of be better independent in their assessments of performance .
mentores should be enseñando otherwise are sending the message of that lie and is are acceptable .
¿ how deception we are ?
in a day who , the studies are that you can lie in any place of 10 to 200 times .
that safe , many of these lies are lies piadosas .
another study was that the issue mentían three times in the first 10 minutes of conocerse .
detect lies , or &quot; the traceability of lies &quot; , is a nicklaus essential must acquire all , reasons therefore personal as occupational .
far of be a game of table similar to , example , charada , where the aim is exclamar : &quot; you have &quot; , the detection the deception is a offshoot the knowledge serious based in data scientific bad for the last six decades in prestigiosas universities held projects of research in depth , especially in psicología and fisiología .
one of the results of the research is that the old mitos about of the lie have been rebatidos .
the mentirosos itself watching to the eyes .
not always tartamudean , balbucean , ruborizan or inquietan .
not can conclude not that the mentirosos are difficult of detect or unmasked .
a detector of lies late can come to the truth teach about of the structure of the declaration , the expresiones microfaciales , the training of questions and the times .
had several years sondeando the descubrimientos scientific on the deception in the spectre and always potential body the knowledge , and was clear that the detection the deception is a techniques modern is easy of learn and aid to steer our complex world - especially if their responsibilities occupational include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations .
the good mentirosos have the nicklaus of read well to the others , haciéndoles feel to will , manejando their own emotion and sintiendo of way intuitiva how the were the others .
know the research extrovertidos mienten more the introvertidos , the men say more &quot; lies global to itself same &quot; , while the women say more lies &quot; global to the other &quot; -- normally to protect feelings of someone -- the people married mienten least emotionally to their partners that the people not are married ( but the lies usually say tend to be &quot; enormous &quot; ) .
also know that if you is noted as a malhechor , the others sentirán least culprits the mentirle .
¿ how know if someone is mintiendo ?
first , will the behaviour customary the inappropriate .
this is &quot; create a line of basis &quot; .
aid to provide points of reference to measure after the changes .
will the position the sujeto , risa and característica showed .
is better will if someone normally golpetea with the ordinary all the time to not do accusations unfair when you see the feet golpeteando in half of the meeting .
to continuation , busque groups of behaviour dull , verbales and not verbales .
states to these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm , not as test of deception .
the people dupe can freeze the part higher the body try of remember their history , can emphasized their feet to the door , inclinarse to a exit , change their position of way significant or exhibir a &quot; desahogo postentrevista &quot; -- that evil suspiro of alivio and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have is .
to often the interrogadores do see falsamente that the interview has is only to seek that alivio postentrevista .
also giving attention the vocabulary the inappropriate .
ayr peterson metió the pata to the fund and usó the time last while regarding that their wife owe was viva , lanzando a search of she to level national .
the people dupe also can use a language distanciador : &quot; not had relations sexual with woman ... the señorita lewinsky &quot; or repeat a question difficult fully .
the indicators verbales more comunes are sutiles .
someone can use a lot of &quot; language restrictive &quot; when says to a question difficult : &quot; good ... to say truth ... to what i ... to my understand . &quot;
this ago that the answer be a percepción in place of a fact and is to often a signal of warning .
not there no formula mágica to detect lies , but develop skills to be the deception is possible .
these skills will the possibilities of who to avoid be victimizados the artists of the mischief in their lives occupational and personal .

when i in she , i reminds the gangs given before , as mudhoney , soundgarden , nirvana and all the arose the same time , and , if there ascendancy now , i that is something marvellous because is music is the penalty listen and gangs as mudhoney are doing now better music that never .
the principle , their music had a content more dark and now has again more positive .

is interesting because i that there a couple of songs in the new borrell time realise more livianas , but also there songs , as the end or just breathe as as songs very shameful although can sound a bit positive .
with ambas , when ed i the tocó , lloré when the known and are songs deeply oscuras .
i that when creces and there some trauma in your life and lose to a family or a friend , these things begin to influence your art and your music and these two songs , doubt , represent that to me .
also , i that can be a person happy and still be do music that be darker .

desalojada a finca okupada where doing macrofiestas
the invaders had adueñado of 11 of the 13 strip the building , in balmes , 51
the 12 ocupantes was the finca the at of yesterday offer resistance
all seems indicate that the pesadilla living the neighbours the 51 of the street of balmes has come to their end .
twelve people abandoned the at of yesterday only the inmueble held illegally , and where organizaban macrofiestas desesperaban vecindario , order legal and need of a intervention police .
when was the operation , changed the cerrojo of the door to avoid that place the situation .
&quot; to from of now will a control of access &quot; , said the administrator .
the okupas , had invadido 11 of the 13 strip the building -el rest are habitados- , were the the plant we and part of the the water , also of paint the walls and stop waste of all kind , on all latas of excess alcoholic .
the three first strip were the stage of the parties multitudinarias , duraban to two days and desesperaban to the inquilinos .
the hand the building there a discoteca , balmes 51 , also has seen such .
their owner , maria pantinat explain to europe reporter since that the building was occupied the business has down a 80 % .
the owner of the discoteca suggests that the invaders of the finca you doing competition unfair , already vendían the copas to three euros , while in the discoteca valen 10 .
also , the propietaria the local of leisure had had that respond to complaints vecinales noise , mientras , that pointed , deal not have the customers of the discoteca , but the inhabitants of the home okupada and , on all , the assistants to the parties organizaban there , had increased their often and times in the last weeks , according the enojados neighbours of the area .

the leader popular explain that before the summer only had a floor the building occupied , but to what long of the last months the okupas had gone their in all the plants the building and in almost all the strip , and that in no even have been robbery .
in this sense added that , &quot; is necessary end with the impunity and be good against the incivismo has led in the finca &quot; .
also yesterday , the mossos desalojaron a building in nou barris .
to the 15.30 hours the police addressed to the 35 of the street of mont-ral , after receive the call of a neighbour had seen that four people accedían building .
the four were detenidos in the time .
¿ park or mountain ?
the architects obliged in the opportunity of the call more beyond of like on pay
the contest municipal on the 16 doors reabre the debate on the role of collserola in barcelona
amediados of the 80 , in full back of the already extinta manoeuvres metropolitana of barcelona ( cmb ) , this administration imprimió a pasquines of promotion of collserola .
the folleto definía the mountain as the great park of the barcelona heavy .
is more , acompañaba of a compared , in figures , with the central park neoyorquino .
with the death of the cmb , in 1987 , the park came to situarse , in the imaginary of many , as the limit higher of barcelona , being the capital catalana of the few not orientan in the which norte-sur but down ( mountain ) -abajo ( sea ) .
the rating of collserola as park natural ensure in this idea .
the reference already not was central park but yellowstone , with the jabalís in the role the oso yogi .
in these was to that , in september , the city convocó a megacompetición independent 16 notice to other so doors of access to collserola .
a door planned to the idea of park , doubt .
or that or someone is put doors field .
the question control single : collserola , ¿ park or mountain ?
the contest , therefore their it merely organizativa as what is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects barceloneses .
is almost already a issue topical the that spoil hand when two member of this former untouchables of elected recognise in a lift .
and this fact is ordinary , exactly , to one of the few coincidencias between what is three architects barceloneses , and teachers university , have have .
miguel roldán , daniel mòdol and marta bayona : the contest is right .
to roldán , after addressed the operating coasts &quot; ago necessary &quot; discuss on &quot; the operating of mountain &quot; , the time the speech of ildefons cerdà , the of the premium greens , not has taken to out .
&quot; next from of the basis of that the park more endemic of barcelona is the beach .
between other things their great accesibilidad .
collserola is more complex &quot; , judgment the architect to who the title of &quot; doors of collserola &quot; there a &quot; trap léxica &quot; : not there that think in them &quot; as the accesos to a park , but the delimitación of a areas where there that act &quot; .
mòdol , as roldán and bayona with experience in the world urbanístico , is the proposal of &quot; challenge intellectual &quot; with &quot; some dangers &quot; .
dangers small of what &quot; uncertain is today day project the space public &quot; after the experience vivida in the 80 and had in the area the fòrum &quot; their ending the cisne &quot; .
the first fear is the own delimitación of a borders on where can build .
&quot; limit something is them already the next step &quot; , is say , their sobrepaso .
&quot; there that think in new instruments urbanísticos , of planning , because the current &#91; in reference plan general metropolitano ( pgm ) &#93; can give ordinary to auténticos disasters &quot; .
more ceñido to the question , mòdol is that , simplificando , the it vallesana of collserola &quot; can should as a park , the of barcelona , not &quot; , a question merely topográfica .
mòdol reminds that already there a work has the patronat of collserola &quot; not must fall in together roto &quot; , although for the opportunity the city offers to their gremio of intervene in this project &quot; since the first time &quot; .
and still more , understand that the cercanía of the mountain with the city is the police allows to the architects into in the debate , but &quot; doubt &quot; on if is this profile technical the must lead the equipment multidisciplinarios ( &quot; all a likewise &quot; , suggests ) have had that create : &quot; the architects should be only a tool &quot; .
bayona implies that the answer to the question is title to this one is complex , because in the foundations the contest missing one vision global of collserola : &quot; have convocado 16 notice direct -dice- in the sense montaña-mar , but not there a reading longitudinal , that see and understands the area in their whole &quot; .
causes , the least in their case , that has chosen participate in the 16 notice .
of another way , a project to one of the doors can chocar in programme and definition with the the architect of the door of the hand .
in their opinion , that , the city should ensure that the strip immediately higher to the round of dalt should envisage , in the their spread , a area of equipamientos efectuara a softly transition between the city and green .
casino perdona to jonás larrazábal and come free
then of 72 days of arraigo , the apoderado legal the casino network otorgó the forgiveness the brother the mayor of monterrey the process you was presuntos chantajes
then of remain 72 days preso , manuel jonás larrazábal come in freedom then of that the apoderado legal the casino network you otorgara the forgiveness to the juzgado second criminal of district , is a process blackmail against the brother the mayor of monterrey .
then the attack casino royale , the propietario the casino network , sergio gil garcia , was public a series of photographs and videos in the presuntamente manuel jonás you requirements the payment of a share economic to that the city regiomontano allowed the operation illegal of the home of risks .
after the concession public , the procuraduría state was a process criminal against the brother the mayor panista and the 2 of september was arrested and becoming 30 days .
then of four hours to the agent the ministry public 3 in crimes patrimoniales , was made to the home of arraigo 1 , within in the area antiguo of the capital the state .
in that place permaneció for the 49 days as the dictársele a second order of arraigo then of that the agent the ministry public desechara the crimes of cohecho and crime organised .
the 19 of october was made the criminal of cadereyta presuntamente chantajear with a million and half of talk to the owners the casino network ; however , only permaneció a hours in the reclusorio of existence security already were threats of death in their against .
the authorities you allowed continue the trial internado in the cells municipal of st santa of the garza .
the 25 of october you revolved order of aprehensión the secretario the juzgado second criminal of district , borg yánez , who said that to almost two months of averiguaciones comprobaron sufficient evidence to determine the proven of jonás , such as the collection of 1.5 million of talk to the representatives of the home of risks to change of allow the operation of the same .
this monday , the apoderado legal of casino network , vittorio aldo garcia gómez , turned to the juzgador josé luis pecina to apply the forgiveness to the brother the mayor regio ; what in the next hours could recover their freedom .
for the diligencia legal , the agent the ministry public adscrito the juzgado , ramiro cañete , cuestionó to garcia gómez if had repaired the damage and who of the partners of the home of risks was the otorgó the forgiveness , although the lawyer tried set the name .
with basis dossier 197 / 2011 make the forgiveness legal to jonás larrazábal and in what sucesivo not will stand complaint any in on process you was ; also of that not you exigirá reparación of damage or punishment .
after the hearing the apoderado legal of the home of risks , closely of the 15 : 50 issued the immediate freedom of larrazabal bretón .
the secretario the juzgado , borg yánez , found to the prison the municipality of st santa of the garza to declare to jonás has been perdonado legally and their dossier will archivado .
also what notificará of the order of freedom immediate issued the judge .
the secretary dionisio royo jácome is details the accident air where lost the life the secretary of gobernación , franz blake , and seven people more
the secretaría of communications and transport ( sct ) informed that the results thrown on the accident where lost the life the secretary of gobernación , franz blake mora , and seven people more , show that the hawk impactó of way direct on the ground in full integrity structural , that the pilot could try a landing hard .
for a conference of press , dionisio royo jácome , secretary of communications and transport , mentioned that before of take the aeronave , the pilot discovered that the conditions of climate were the right to fly .
&quot; the elements seem indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the aspas had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselaje &quot; .
also informed that the unit was sewn to 19 people , what had with the requerimientos necessary to carry the personal .
also , said that in the research made in the area the impact not reporta the emergence of parts in the ground .
&quot; in a search do that not there parts or components of the nave in another place , the impact presented of way structural .
&quot; the design the hawk was to 19 passengers , had with requerimientos suitable to trasportar to the passengers .
the ground is a outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of gradient .
the time , the secretary was that is a priority have with the results before possible ; however , the research can last several months , even could achieve a year .
their part , gilberto valverde shaw , director general of airports and services auxiliares , was that time the impact , the hawk the state army presidencial operaba in speed of cruise and that this happened in a ground blando ascending .
&quot; this information strengthens the hipótesis of a operation normal of cruise time the impact &quot; , expressed .
in the conference of press , the favours of the sct , royo jácome , enumeró six element relevant in the research :
flight about :
with to the normatividad classifies the flight was under the rules of flight about , this means that the tripulación must have visibility for the flight and the ground .
conditions likely :
the reportes in the aicm ubicaban conditions right the tens , with is the aeronave to the area worrying between the df and the state of mexico made drainage of nubosidad to low level .
routes seleccionadas :
is likely that the conditions of nubosidad it tripulación has buscada a area of will course and greater visibility to the valley of cuernavaca .
location the impact .
the coordenadas of impact and the last registration of the aeronave the radar obliged , probably before the impact not there loss of control or at in the background of flight .
dispersión of remains of the aeronave in a area reduced :
the information available to the time is mean that the impact happened in a background straight and of hand .
the patrón of dispersión of remains of the aeronave is mean that the hawk impactó in the ground in conditions of integrity structural .
not has been fact of ceasefire or explosion :
in the website the right are revelarse evidencias in the remains of the nave of some kind of explosion or ceasefire .
the last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground .
for the jobs of field have found parts of the aeronave to a course of 9 thousand 200 feet on the level average the sea , the ground is a outstanding is since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of gradient .
the photographs are the sequence in the expected desarticuló to what long of way .
the information provided elements seem indicate that the hawk could have had multiple impactos in the ground .
after of the search thorough in a area more wider that the website acordonado , around the accident , not have found parts over of the aeronave , what strengthens the presumption of that the impact presented in conditions of integrity structural .
mss is protocol to finding gene of obesity
is the sure social a research to be the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is out in specialists the ipn
the institute participate the sure social ( imss ) announced that is a research to be the gene of the obesity in children and people , protocol &apos; genética of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , will have with marcadores artistic obesity .
in a release , the head of the unit of research médica in bioquímica the hospital of especialidades the centre doctor national century century , miguel cross valverde , explain that taken a team multidisciplinario of doctors , nurses , nutriólogos and workers social .
team is out specialists and a of postgrado the institute national of health public ( insp ) and the centre of research and of studies avanzados ( cinvestav ) the institute politécnico national ( ipn ) .
in the research foot to participate to the population be or not derechohabiente , come to the units sporting ensure the imss in the valley of mexico , where have to out the evidence to the age , all the lottery to from of the 8 : 00 hours .
upgrading that the protocol started in the unit deportiva cuauhtémoc ( state of mexico poniente ) and since the 8 of october , the activity has to out in the unit deportiva nezahualcóyolt ( state of mexico east ) .
a time having the aim of put to 500 or 600 age , the study stated in the unit deportiva independence ( south the district federal ) and finally in the unit deportiva morelos ( at north the district federal ) .
explain that the purpose of this research is know the components and the importance of the genetic with regard development of the obesity and identify in children and people mexican factors of risk to prevent the emergence of diseases chronic degenerativas .
the held this 14 of november the day world of the disease , precisó that the aim is put to three thousand children and young between at and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , to the implementation of cuestionarios specific on food .
also them preguntará on the activity physical and background heredofamiliares of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk desencadenen padecimientos as disease or inadequacy renal .
detalló that the lottery them applies to all the participants mediciones antropométricas ( weight , stature , circumference of cintura ) , take of pressure many , determination of the levels of glucosa , triglicéridos , colesterol and insulin and genetic ( seeking identify genes asocien to the obesity child ) .
cross valverde pointed that this research regard to the concern of the professionals of the health the alarming increase of weight in the age .
&apos; the surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 open that in so only six years there a increase , in the case of the children , of 77 cent in obesity , and of the girls of 47 cent ; in terms of obesity also observed a rise dramatic &apos; , upgrading the specialist the imss .
expressed that the justification to the search of the marcadores sustenta in that the population the country do of others their history genetic .
informed that in average , the participate has 65 cent of inheritance indian american , 30 cent european and five cent through and this condition is in the genes take to disease and too of weight .
explain that of way general , the genetic of the obesity translates in the inability of throwing the too of energy consumimos ( lowcalorie ) and transported in way of blubber .
the researchers explain that the benefit direct to the participants is the assessment due of the children , what allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity .
even , said , it presence of pliegues of colour obscuro ( acantosis ) in bottleneck and antebrazo , show the likelihood of that padezca alteraciones metabólicas and to prediabetes .
the information expose of way confidential , the doctors the entregan writing to the parents , to who them is every one of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life must be to prevent diseases .
cross valverde explain that there three components main cause obesity , obesity and others padecimientos crónicos : the sedentarismo , is the lack of activity physical daily , remain the greater part the day clear with the television and use media of transport in place of moving distances planes .
also must to the high ingesta calórica , is say , the greater consumption of excess azucaradas , of carbohidratos ( tamales , bread , pizza , clones , etc ) with high content in tallow and protein and the genetic analysing in this protocol .
stains of the unam evitaría pretty
raphael herrera , researchers of the faculty of química of the unam , develops asfaltos gm with polímeros to produce a with better course , regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature
if the signals are the pavimento are met , not would necessary reparar closely of 200 thousand pretty every season of sumatra in the area metropolitana the valley of mexico , warned raphael herrera nájera , researchers of the faculty of química ( fq ) of the unam , who was that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a pavimento asfáltico is the appropriate , the pretty could reducirse in amount or , even , be complete .
in their conference a opinion technological of the pretty , dictada in the framework the year international of the química , was to know that the laboratory to their office develops asfaltos gm with polímeros to produce a with characteristics insignificant to the the stains , but with a greater resistance mechanics , therefore to highest as to dribs temperatures .
herrera nájera estimó that this kind of asfaltos gm could used in places where the climate is extremely warm , as some cities the north the country , to improve their course and , what therefore , the training of pretty .
explain that the stains , the part more heavy the oil , is a whole of moléculas of hidrocarburos , a of high weight molecular , on asfaltenos , and others of under weight molecular , on maltenos , north you are to pavimento their characteristic behaviour viscoelástico .
the behaviour viscoelástico the stains is in that to highest temperatures , closely of the 180 degrees , means as a cosmetic , to 120 degrees degree their viscosidad is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest , while to temperatures very low , the stains again quebradizo , added .
what previous means that in the streets the resistance the stains not is uniform , but is constitutes for the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature , warned the specialist in engineering chemistry .
the researchers of the fq observed that the streets of the city of mexico in their majority are covered pavimento flexible , the which consists of six drainage of materials , of the which the last three involucran stains .
between the drainage more superficiales is the carpeta asfáltica , conformada small stones bañadas in stains and then compactadas .
every a of the piedritas is the carpeta , pointed , is bañada with stains .
the transitar the vehicles and generarse efforts , this allows that the forces are very well in the pavimento .
if like of stains that difundirían still best , did the engineering chemical .
on the carpeta asfáltica , abundó , put a last layer called carpeta of rodadura , the which is pale of a material of stone fine , is say , a bit also baña in stains .
as is of the layer is to be in contact with the llantas of the vehicles , must have more force mechanics that the carpeta asfáltica and provide fricción in the way .
the be the part the pavimento is to receive and salvage the efforts , the carpeta of rodadura required , also , have the thick appropriate and must are the material the is pale .
the climate , especially the moisture and the shift of temperature , also are a factor very important to be , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the course of the carpeta asfáltica .
when the ground humedece , the water disseminate in the interior of the carpeta and is difficult that have , this results a reblandecimiento of all the drainage the pavimento and , what therefore , the training of pretty .
in the process of training of a bache , said , the first in desgastarse is the film of rodamiento and only after affects the carpeta asfáltica , but the damage not happens instantáneamente , but is a process should atenderse to the first signals with suitable programmes of peacekeeping .
the also member the system national of researchers explain that the burden vehicular is another factor important in the training of pretty and , , the thick of every one of the drainage the pavimento must go always in relationship with the burden vehicular and ensure that having , to avoid that train pretty emotionally .
raphael herrera warned that still there a investigate and work on the stains , example , the emulsiones asfálticas , in other countries already are even in the market and is reparar the pretty with easily and need of use highest temperatures .
¿ what you meet to the cresson the valley to be the new señorita colombia ?
analysis of the factors incidieron to that melina ramírez serna not alcanzara the nickel of señorita colombia .
the valley receives their title number 14 of princess .
of new the valley the cauca is with the politics of the nickel of señorita colombia .
this time melina ramírez serna had that shaping with be in the podio of ganadoras , lucir the nickel of silver and the broadband it acreditan as new princess of colombia .
with the result agonising anoche in cartagena , where the señorita atlantic alzó with the nickel and the cetro , the department already adds 14 titles of princess and melina a to the legion of women vallecaucanas have been closely of the nickel but that were proclamas princesas between them of ospina benoit ( 1947 ) , clara domínguez borrero ( 1949 ) , from bellini ayala ( 1979 ) , daewoo álvarez ( 1981 ) , rose mary alzate ( 1983 ) , olga maría arenas ( 1987 ) , leila blanque ( 1988 ) , mónica evers ( 1989 ) , maría consuela pinedo ( 1990 ) , diana isabel romero ( 1993 ) , giselle garcés aljure ( 2000 ) , catalina giraldo ( 2007 ) , stephanie garcés aljure ( 2008 ) .
today the great question that many do is ¿ what meet ?
because the result represents the defeat of a great favorita in every presentation proved that she had everything to be the new señorita colombia , not in vain was elected lies of the police and best face jolie of vogue , titles were reinas as taliana vargas or natalia navarro who were the nickel of señorita colombia .
the first factor as key in the decision took the jury of designarla first princess plays in that not convenció with their answer to the question &quot; ¿ what is that book you has separated to you and what ? pale martín murillo gómez , of the carreta literaria leamos .
the interrrogante the vallecaucana did :
&quot; read much , i quite in the literature , i that is a way of culturalizarse , definitely i that the book i espoused of childhood is &quot; the principito &quot; , is a book quite shared .
currently read &quot; crime and punishment &quot; , is a book of literature universal all must read ; and today in day am read the book of irene nemirovski , a russian , a book hermosísimo is &quot; the ardor of the blood &quot; &quot; .
a answer little was first the term &quot; culturalizarse &quot; and second not explain of way particular of what way every one of the books citó the have separated .
but at conclude the ceremony melina manifested sentirse relaxed and happy with the result &quot; the universe is sabio is what has that happen .
and to the the people , favour read a poquito , &quot; the principito &quot; is a great book &quot;
between the hipótesis outer says that to valley it quemó the favoritismo .
a journalist bogotano insinuó that the be the respected , the ovacionada and the cresson was all the prizes hypothetical ( challenge of gastronomía oster , vote the public the best suit once , and lies mother ) , &quot; that kindled the celos of the other candidate , estresó to the lies and that not brilló in the stage &quot; .
and that notó in their first presentation in suit of bathing in the beach the hilton and their two desfiles in the evening of coronación .
although in both lució safe , notó that you missing the force and the impetus the representatives of magdalena and atlantic deployed .
ariel osorio , journalist the programme &quot; as in home &quot; , the channel rcn did that the fact of that melina would designada princess &quot; fallen that the cresson more prizes earns for the contest not is as lies &quot; .
also , valley was to what last very esquiva with the press , and equivocó .
one hipótesis is that valley not issued convince the jury on their interest to the work social , is in last , the essence the contest national of beauty .
something , two days before of the election the jury international lucy doughty manifested that them buscaban a woman comprometida with the needs social of their pais .
&quot; the beauty single not is in a miss colombia , there that look region beyond of what physical and look in their sensitivity social , that before of imply the contest are already involucradas in projects &quot; , explain .
also especula that valley pecó their flaws in the derriere and the fibrosis you notaba in their abdomen , but is contradictorio because precisely the jury the was as the cresson &apos; beauty natural &apos; with the body more healthy , good food and work physical responsible .
the preparador of reinas borg hernán orozco recognised that melina not had the best body , had best , &quot; but their problem of fibrosis in the abdomen , the truth to my not was very notoria , you bowed points in the last day &quot; .
between therefore the journalist guido hoyos , of the magazine cromos as that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the speeches quirúrgicas practicó .
&quot; the cirugías are well , but valley not was do .
their body never was their as and here it cobraron &quot; .
this prize , first time entrega the contest national of the beauty , after the parade in suit of bathing did a vaticinio anoche perform , because said that this was the contentillo raymundo you concedía to melina to not should the will of the nickel .
reality or not , what true is that melina since today starts a year of reinado , not as sovereign , but as princess , position you offered the possibility of represent to colombia in one of the certámenes international designation the own contest national .
however , she will to the history as a of the reinas to despite of their arrollador step cartagena , you was esquiva the nickel .
was the work the caleño designated the cadáver of alfonso cano
a lofoscopista of cali happened to the history as the man confirmed the death of &quot; alfonso cano &quot; .
the work of these officials is key .
the last 4 of november a lofoscopista the cti of cali happened to the history as the man confirmed the identity the full head of the farc : &quot; alfonso cano &quot; , to through the cotejo of their fingerprints digital .
of the seven lofoscopistas laboran in the seccional the cti , week you tocaba the time of &quot; availability &quot; to eliazar gonzález , a man of port tejada has 21 years working in the area of research legal .
the to their career , gonzález worked in municipalities the chocó , where many times had that internarse more of five days in the jungle to come the website in the were the bodies be be identificados .
in the 2000 found to the capital the valley and , then of be the courses appropriate , especializó in lofoscopia , is the study of the fur of fricción , is say , of the palmas of the hands and of the feet .
the week the operational against alias alfonso cano to eliazar you warned that bring clothes minimum to three days .
something large you expected .
the friday in the night went to the cauca in a hawk since palmira .
was that should identify two bodies and sospechaba that one of them was the man respected to the guerrilla more former the world , what you were that bring the card decadactilar of guillermo lion sáenz ( their real name ) .
however , when was with the team of research the website in the was the cadáver not recognised their aspect physical , because was very different the that had seen in the media of communication .
was barba , reasonable as a bewilderment of the area , glasses and much more young .
but the fingerprints not mienten .
linked of a lupa galtoniana , tinta , a transplantador and a linterna , eliazar comparó the fingerprints fingerprints the cadáver with the of the card .
their eye not you falló : was &quot; alfonso cano &quot; .
same night , the man oriundo of port tejada was the responsible of confirmarle minister of defence , john iv pinzón , itself was the full head of the farc .
in search of the imprint
to a dactiloscopista of the sijín of cali the recognition was the president john manuel resort to eliazar gonzález , in the wheel of press the operational against &quot; cano &quot; , is very significant .
a people not known our work .
the dactiloscopia is a science accurate , margin of mistake , can come to be key in the resolution of crimes .
apart of the identification of bodies , the lofoscopistas support research crimes as hurto and murder and bear the identity of the people capturadas .
when arrested , many criminals have cédulas wishful or not have papers .
us them we the impression dactilar and the look in the basis of data .
the researchers counted that , in a case of hurto , you tocó denied a part of wall of a home , because in that place the aymara had supported their hand to from a box strong full of joyas and money .
&quot; the walls are difficult because not are land apropiadas to from a impression dactilar , but in that case we obtain the imprint of the the hand and identify at criminal , had participated in different hurtos &quot; , reminded .
the fingerprints also can seeking or reaffirm acts in cases of murder .
ago little found to a man dead , with cabin of licor to their around .
of the research determinó that a family could be using the crime and , indeed , a imprint in the bottleneck coincidía .
although this not does that has been the murderer , ubica in the scene the crime .
a dactiloscopista the cti explain that in the items &quot; the fingerprints sacan with reactivos chemical or physical &quot; .
when receiving , used a transplantador or tape to levantarlas .
then of this , the fingerprints are settlement to the asif , is the basis of data delincuencial , or to the registraduría .
&quot; the problem is that still there many columbians xenophobic &quot; , expressed the expert the cti .
aclaró that not all is as shows in the programme of television csi .
as not all what make is gold , not all what is again imprint .
however , if can be usada , if do the cotejo dynamic .

the cdu proposes choose the president european suffrage universal
the first day the congress of the union cristiano-demócrata ( cdu ) , the monday 14 of november , in leipzig , has been difficulties to merkel merkel , chancellor and madam the party cristiano-demócrata .
initially not had including in the order the day the future of europe , but the issue imposed in autumn , in particular to satisfy to the fighters feel that the policy the government is currently too little strict with the greeks and could become in a future with the italians .
the motion on the presidency of the commission european , proposal the direction , adopted virtually unanimity .
of the 1.001 delegates , so only registered nine votes in against and ten abstenciones .
the standing ovation of several minutes ganaron , with their speeches , merkel merkel and , after several hours , wolfgang schäuble , the eurófilo minister of finance , despejan any doubt possible .
the idea key of the chancellor , and of the motion , resumen in a motto : the answer to the crisis &quot; not is least europe , but more europe &quot; .
not only because europe is the peace , but also because &quot; nine million of jobs on directly the euro &quot; .
to the chancellor , &quot; has come the time of open way in europe &quot; .
this could expressed in amendments the treaty of lisbon to allow strengthen the control of the union european on the policies budgetary of the countries of the area the euro , although also could desembocar in the election the president of the commission european suffrage universal to &quot; should a face to europe &quot; .
in all case , that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted the congress , clearly idea of wolfgang schäuble .
doubt , is little likely that the veintisiete come quickly to a agreement on this change radical : britain britain shows hostile to he and the leaders of the cdu seem know that nicolas sarkozy also .
but the demand is on the ground .
another hand , the delegates have rejected a majority overwhelming the proposal of ponderar the weight of every country of the directive the bank central european in role the weight of every economy , what which obviously reforzaría the weight of germany .
ansiosa calmar the encouraged in the interior of their party , the chancellor has increased the reference to konrad adenauer and helmut kohl . but not is that has tried gain to their congress to coast of the &quot; small &quot; countries european or of the countries in difficulties ready to criticise to the arrogant germany .
although the motion on europe spins a paragraph to the importance of &quot; the friendship franco-alemana &quot; , merkel merkel not has mentado to france .
salvo of last .
thinking that , ago two centuries , in a bloody battle in leipzig .
of done , was one of the derrotas more humiliating to the army of rostopchine .
the impact the fraud in the dribs disease
after the benefits , the ump and the government emprenden a attack against the dribs disease .
nicolas sarkozy will the tuesday 15 of november in bordeaux to visiting a box responsible of the benefits family and pronounce a speech on the issue , already topical since 2007 , of the fight against the fraud social and the ayudantía .
also , to restructure attack , that part of the will of save of way thorough , but still reminds to a which of the campaign presidential of right , the majority want look in the dribs disease .
in first place , to apply cuts budgetary : the government is impose to the workers the sector private a fourth day of we before of power catch the lower .
in final , unless that there a convention of company specific , a worker that caiga diseased lose four days of wage , is say , a minimum the 15 % of their income per .
is of a measure could get a wave of ira , but would save 280 million of eur , according them echos .
also , would accompanied of another measure with a reach more symbolic : impose to the officials a day of we pay in case of lower labour ( to the time , not have we , with to the three days that apply in the sector private ) .
while debaten these issues , the majority again to put on the table also the issue the fraud , this time looking to the abuses of the dribs labour .
&quot; van to incrementarse significantly the controls and , also , if discover to someone planned a fraud , must reembolsar the cuantías &quot; , warned xavier bertrand talking in the rtl the sunday 13 of november .
the as in the other cases , the effects the announcement seem slightly desproporcionados to the reality the fraud in of dribs labour .
of done , since 2002 do a monitoring constant of this question and have masks various more policies , normally , have given as .
the people not enferman more that in the rest of europe .
handed with attention , in first place , the figures national .
according the institute french of the security social ( cnam ) , in 2006 abonaron more of 237 million of eur in benefits dribs labour .
according the institute french of research and documents in economy of the health , the benefits the dribs representaron , in 2008 , the 5 % the expenditure health , ascendiendo to 11.300 million of eur .
of this sum , the 46 % is to the dribs leave and accidents labour , while the 54 % is related with the dribs disease , figure amounts to 6.200 million of eur .
therefore , the 2,5 % the expenditure in health .
in 2010 , the people have cogido a average of 14,5 days of lower labour , with to 17,8 in 2009 , according a study the group soul consulting .
a average , doubt , is government : one survey , published in 2007 the view of management professional monster.com , mostraba that the 75 % of the 40.000 workers french encuestados rushing that not had cogido not a only day of lower disease .
another study , in this case of the assurance maladie , could that in 2010 the 37 % of the dribs disease had a duration less to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more long .
if the compared with our neighbours european , the workers french not are more propensos that in other areas to catch dribs disease .
a long study out in 2010 two researchers the cnrs given that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of lack global the work ( therefore reasons of health as of another kind ) oscilaba , in france , between the 10 % and the 11 % , with to a 20 % and a 28 % in denmark , a 15 % in uk uk or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the countries netherlands .
the fraud in the dribs disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not undeclared .
the fraud has a reach quite limited .
the forward of the legislation , since 2002 , has caused that the controls of the dribs disease of more of 45 days are sistemáticos .
in 2008 , of 1,5 million of inspections , the cnam comprobó , in a 13 % of the 285.000 by , the dribs of shorter duration were &quot; unjustified or too we &quot; , is say , 37.050 cases .
in the case of the dribs of more of 45 days , untreated to inspections sistemáticas , was that the 11 % of the cases were &quot; rightly adaptados or injustificados ; a figure , taking as starting a total of 1,2 million , amounts to 132.000 .
therefore , high a total of 169.000 cases &quot; injustificados &quot; between several million of workers cogieron a lower disease .
doubt , a figure minor in compared , example , with the work in black .
according the member of the ump dominique tian , author of a report on this question in june , that practice will a losses of income tax of between 9.000 and 15.000 million of eur year , is say , more that the cost total of the benefits dribs and , doubt , significantly more that the fraud in this last area .

policy energy :
the facts must assert more that the dogmas
if there a issue not can try taking in account considerations of short term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy .
the availability and the cost of the electricity have directly in the power you and in the competitiveness of the companies .
is appropriate that a meeting electoral be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear .
the debate only will useful if investigated the whole of the consequences economic , social and environmental of the options proposed .
the people must resorted their opinion in made objectives , in data rational .
now are 7.000 million of people in the planet , the development demographic afflicted the duplication of the demand we before of 2050 , to least prive to a huge part of the population global of a element vital .
the same time , will that afflicting the shortage every time greater of the resources fossil to continue have electricity continually , forget the imperiosa need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse to fight against the change climate , a issue has disappeared the debate ecological .
the accident of fukushima not change none of these parameters .
that , germany takes single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear .
that not is the case or of belgium , hearing the their to the need of find a source capable of sustituirla , or of switzerland , only has aim build power of last generation .
another hand , britain britain , finland , poland , republic czech , countries netherlands , sweden , south , china , india and brazil , quote some examples , are forward with determination with their projects .
the states united , their hand , after fukushima have add a unit to their park , retomando the construction of a central interrumpida after the accident of three mile island .
if the model german , based in the energy renewable , is in times as example , the reality is in against of speech .
the election of berlin is to mean a encarecimiento the price of the electricity , a greater dependence energy the need incrementada of gas imported , in particular of russia , a increase of the emissions of co2 the construction of power of gas and of coal .
in a months , notarán the effects harmful .
must meditarse on the case of denmark .
campeón of europe in the sector eólico , the which provide the 30 % of their electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the intermitencia the wind ; this reason , their emissions of co2 and the price of their electricity are , respectively , a 65 % and a 50 % more high that the average european .
the otherwise , thanks to the information of our policy energy , our neighbours abonan a bill of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the homes french .
while in a economy globalised the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the peacekeeping of the usefulness industrial in the territory national , the companies french benefit of the electricity more cheap of europe .
reason , any reduction significant of the energy nuclear would a strong increase the price of the electricity , what restaría realism to the maravillosas statements on the reindustrialización of our country and the defence of our power you .
is of a price the great majority of the people refuse to pay and , of fact , not manifiestan opposition principle to that kind of energy , that are the surveys .
remember that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with 125.000 jobs of work director and 410.000 jobs indirectos .
widely looking to the export , encompasses a galaxy of pymes towards in the markets international and can create jobs not deslocalizables .
if france decidiese leave the energy nuclear , would the sacrificio of great part of these smes and the loss of the 6.000 million of eur annual in exports french of equipment and services nuclear .
¿ what electricista encargaría a epr designed to work sixty years , when is to the collapse of their manufacturer ?
to put it equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity , the as not there a source diabólica .
the development part of areva of solutions with low emissions of co2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the nature complementary of the sources of energy .
in the case of the energy nuclear , is essential keep the full level of security .
in france , have of a authority of security exercised a control narrower and transparent therefore on the power existing as on the construction of flamanville .
our equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also more the security .
in half century , the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious .
so only one , the of three mile island , in in a conditions operational normal ; not was consequences or to the people or to the environment .
in chernobyl , the accident was design the reactor and to a failures human imperdonables .
in fukushima , some people seem forget that the accident was to two disasters natural of a reach unprecedented , caused the death of tens of thousands of people .
the sector nuclear aprenderá of this accident , as was of the two previous .
thanks to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and builders french and german , the epr is a design capable of resistir to such phenomena .
while what estudian all the players electric want build a central , the interruption of their construction in flamanville would a great gift to the competitors of areva and edf , since them cease way free to taking the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear .
is essential and legitimate seek the best options energéticas to our country , but would irresponsible stop that the statehood , the dogmas and the volume partisanas dominasen a debate so important to the situation economic , social and financial of our country .
the immigration , ¿ a burden or a opportunity to the economy ?
the policy of immigration applied nicolas sarkozy has been criticada has since various points of view : the saturación of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the compatibility of this policy with the statute autoproclamado of &quot; country of the rights human &quot; of france .
more recently , is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the has saltado to the headlines , with the minister of interior ( véase the newspaper libération the 23 of may ) proclamando of past that france &quot; not needs talentos foreign , workers or camareros &quot; .
however , rarely time analysing since the point of view economic .
the question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the left and the right .
in the case of the right , jacques chirac fijó the it declarando in 1976 that &quot; 900.000 unemployment not should be a problem to a country has with closely of two million of workers migrant &quot; , while in the left , the tone fijó michel rocard explicando that france &quot; not can have office of the the misery the world &quot; in 1990 .
the only difference , the degree of generosity
in 2005 , therefore the left as the right compartían the fear to the invasion the territory national a a of fontaneros poles .
to both both , as that the immigrants are a burden to the economy and the society french .
the only difference is in the degree of generosity with the act with regard to the immigrants .
in their programme , mitterrand hollande limited to include banalidades , those that the codesarrollo will put the &quot; problem of the migration &quot; .
this idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is profitable electoralmente , but economically control very you .
such as guarding the economists ian goldin and geoffrey cameron in a labour recent like the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( exceptional people : how migration shaped our world and will define our future , may of 2011 , princeton university reporter , 352 pp . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries receive immigrants .
the manner of the immigration distorts the growth and is employment .
the fears about with the impact of the immigrants based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national , in particular to the little specialised , pressing to that reduce their wages .
but the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well additional substitutes of the workers national and who mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment .
the immigrants little specialised working in sectors not get to workers national and the more specialised in sectors dynamic where the training not is the demand of staff .
a effect positive on the wages
strategic same way a vladmir would difficulties to work in a country have lack of anestesistas , the complementariedad between national and migrant causes that the arrival of these last invest welcome in the wages and the employment of the national .
taking in account what previous , giovanni peri calculó that a increase the 1 % of the flows migratory is a increase of the wages real to long term of between a 0,6 and a 0,9 % .
and , have in account the fact of that the diversity aportan the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and growth economic ( there a great proportion of prizes nobel american naturalizados and companies as google , intel , paypal , ebay and yahoo were degrading immigrants ) .
the immigrants also are taxpayers net to the systems social , since aportan of average a 1 % the budget total in the countries european .
the organisation international the work estimated , example , in germany a inmigrante comes with a age of 30 years will a contribution neta ( income least expenditure ) of 150.000 eur to the budgets public of average for the their life .
the principle of their mandate , nicolas sarkozy wanted go to seek the points of growth you faltaban &quot; with the nail &quot; .
these nail , disuadieron to the immigrants , had exactly the effect reverse .
europe invented the democracy , only you missing think in a democracy european
the democracy is a good precious , but also fragile .
the continent european should be acordarse of already , although invented in athens ago more of two thousand years , to what long the century the has suffered the tragedies of the war world , totalitarismos , the holocaust , the roots , but also to franco in spain , to salazar in portugal , the coroneles in greece .
some perhaps believed that , to that the democracy triunfase definitely on their enemies , would enough exercise the vote and the way more direct possible .
know , since rostopchine &quot; the of &quot; , was of something restricted .
the suffrage universal , although is of a condition necessary to the democracy , not is enough only and even can become in a &quot; instrument of oppression &quot; , as said most the filósofo republicano etienne vacherot .
not , the democracy required much more : a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , lights , solidarity economic and social , justice .
the crisis live in europe is a crisis economic , but is to point of corner in a crisis political and democratic .
the palinodia the referendum greek verdadero-falso had , to this regard , a double effect demonstrates : was the need of a return take of the sphere political , but also the worrying feeling of their alternatively , of their inconsistency .
must reflexionarse on this ambivalence to superarla .
the truth is that the lines the with of the battle democratic currently have desplazado and that , in many cases , the soldiers republican already not making in the good sense .
not saldremos gaining if we a catalogue of referenda national , problematic in role of the needs and of way desordenada .
a signing in white the monarca european all or a high the hollow the hole nacionalista : ¡ what options to the citizen !
not , not want from coups of effect , but a exercise common , of point right , relaxed and ongoing , of the options and the democracy , this time to level european .
not there crisis in greece , italy , spain , portugal ( of fact , not sabríamos where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of europe .
the whole of europe is the pliega to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , the suffering their powerlessness and their lack of solidarity .
is the whole of europe the suffering a humiliation in the sphere international .
we preaching the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but is the europe the lose slowly the sovereignty and , with she , every one of their nations .
what more urgent is that the sovereignty popular restore the helm the project european .
because only together will the europeans reduce the weight of their debts , liberarse of the markets and preparing their future by the investment .
the exit of the crisis putting decisions to level european not will be a legitimacy democratic total , unless that be to conducirnos disaster .
after have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of jacques delors , all the world calls in the today a governance economic european .
that be .
but think in she a greater integration political and democratic , and that be vivida as such the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new point dead .
must taking a new stage of the construction european .
to build the republic in france , was be &quot; do &quot; republican .
the revolution motivated interests not would enough .
this lesson is being applicable .
must build a europe more an since the point of view economic .
only will achieve build a europe more democratic in the level political , a real sovereignty popular european .
to build europe , let europeans .

&quot; is of a progress , but doubt must wait to poseer evidence more formal before of speak of cooperation operational between aqmi and boko haram &quot; .
&quot; but is possible &quot; .
&quot; know since ago years it secta have of support financial and intellectual foreign and that every time is more active &quot; , says kunle amuwo , a researchers nigeriano .
these last months , these &quot; support &quot; had found every time more clear in the development and the speeches of boko haram or in their case operational , now involve the use of kamikazes or equipment explosivos every time more complex and the same lifestyle category aqmi .
the community international , beginning washington , is since then pressing to abuya to have in account the problems much boko haram .
the authorities grave , of fact , have time considering group as a community of iluminados little understandable of interest .
a success rapid
bizarre in 2002 in maiduguri in on to a mezquita , a school and imán fundamentalista succession yusuf , boko haram ( means , in hausa , &quot; the education western is a pecado &quot; ) , spreading to the both of a emirato islamic in the north muslim of nigeria .
in this region poor , the partnership is living a success rapid .

the reaction of abuya was , as is happen , widespread .
the army atacó the city and registered 800 dead .
succession yusuf , arrestado in life , receives the death in prison .
since then , the secta radicaliza and abandon their feudos the north .
the big holidays , eye a attack cause 80 dead in jos and , after , one in abuya .
in june , boko haram again to attack against abuya , in particular against the barracks general protected of the police , with a attack suicidal , the first of this kind .
in august , the headquarters local of the nations un becomes in their first aim international .

the world that candidates republican to the presidency
in relationship with china , with iran and with the aid to israel , mitt romney , herman cain , and rick perry vying in simpleza and lack of knowledge .
a america debilitada the crisis , ¿ can manage a world complex with ideas simple or , even , simplistas ?
listening to the candidates republican to the presidential , the electorate could think that is .
since ago a days , mitt romney , herman cain , rick perry and the other candidates every time do more statements estruendosas and atajos in of policy foreign , traditionally a point strong of the republicanos .
extienden the lemas , to often infundamentados , on china , iran , the aid to israel .
mitt romney , the candidate best in the career to the designation the &quot; cardiff old party &quot; , has threatened with carry to the chinese to the wto and denunciarles &quot; manipulation of their motto &quot; , a issue key in a america exasperada the migration of fragmentos flows of their sector to asia .
is just if that means the explosion of a war commercial , said .
jon huntsman , former ambassador of obama in china and the only candidate has a vision sofisticada of the policy foreign , almost ahoga to a attitude &quot; apabulla &quot; the emotion .
has asked a dialogue clear , but equivalence , with beijing ( the position current of obama ) .
but huntsman , is reached in the day of the polls , is being inaudible .
the lifestyle of reagan
romney also has promised a intervention military in iran if the sanctions not achieve find their programme nuclear .
&quot; if salgo elected , detendré to iran &quot; , fanfarroneó .
&quot; if obama control reelegido , will the bomb &quot; .
promised also increase the aid military to israel , acusando to obama of have failed with their obligations in relationship with that partner .
the entrepreneur herman cain , the second candidate best clasificado , shows their part a lack embarrassing of such subjects .
recently , instaba to counter to the threat military chinese because beijing &quot; is develop capacity nuclear &quot; , apparently carrying the fact of that china already have the átomo military since 1964 .
the governor tejano rick perry , that supports to israel and want intervene in iran , says that , their part , is ready to orbiting the army us in mexico to fight against the which of the drugs .
the appeal to the torture against the supposed terrorists , outside obama in 2009 , also preconizan cain , perry and the cresson michele bachmann .
the differences are considerable with the candidate republicano of 2008 , john mccain , a weight heavy in policy foreign .
the opponents the current president contestan that reagan also had ideas simple and won the war cold .
are that the own obama was a amateur and had that aflojar the piston in of fight against the terrorism .
insisten , with reason , in the failure of their ingenuo dialogue with iran , in the exit imperative of the &quot; boys &quot; of iraq and in their tergiversaciones in libya , and etiquetan of weak .
but the attacks not them are court .
the population juzga of a way more well positive the balance of security national of obama , is with laden laden .
since iraq , desconfía of the speeches military generate a hundimiento .
and , argumentando that ago lack rebuild economically america to revive their leadership , obama is the impression of be more fair .
the nord stream , new door of entry the gas russian in europe
the pipeline nord stream , comunica directly europe western with russia happening the fund the sea baltic , already has since in service .
must supply gas to satisfy the needs of so million of homes .
gazprom , the gigante russian the gas , has wanted there the event with great pompa .
the last tuesday , more of 500 invited , including four heads of state and of government , took to banks the baltic , between the music of the orquesta and a delicate bufet , in the opening the nord stream , the new pipeline comunica directly , under the sea , russia with germany .
symbolically , the chancellor german merkel merkel , the president russian dmitri indication , the prime minister french mitterrand fillon and their homólogo of the countries netherlands , mark rutte , have girado together the volante of the válvula controls the entry of gas russian in the network of europe western .
with this new pipeline , every year that 27,5 million of metres cubic of gas russian additional to europe western to through of a first had of 1.224 km that comunican the region of st petersburg with the land of mecklemburgo-pomerania .
a second tubo should concluirse to end of 2012 will supply a total of 55.000 million of metres cubic of gas , is say , enough to cover all the consumption french .
also , already about of the possibility of build a third tubo the same way .
to gazprom , the completion to time of this huge labour is aires of victory .
poland and the countries baltic had are strongly the project .
of done , the nord stream is to allow supply gas directly to germany , preventing the course earth third countries ( poland and ukraine ) .
of coup , these two countries some something of their power : to them , will more difficult influence in russia amenazándola with cerrarle the access to the markets of europe western .
in the point álgido the debate , warsaw not dudó in compare the nord stream as a &quot; new pact germano-soviético &quot; , in reference to the alliance between hitler and stalin to should poland in 1939 .
is say , if the issue is politically delicate .
europe western , support the project russian , has obtained a greater security of supply .
but the price is a weakening of the europe of the energy , given the project has led a gap between the europeans the this and the west .
russia has known , in so only five years , do triunfar their vision of a alliance direct between russia and the countries western rich , large consumers of gas and with a reserves every time more limited .
&quot; this pipeline is a component of our partnership with russia , a new arteria we unite of way conventional &quot; , confirmed mitterrand fillon for the opening the pipeline , proving to what point the contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic .
all this is the broad smiles in the sides of the superiors of gazprom , many in lubmin , in the point of arrival the gas .
the construction of this pipeline also is a achievement technical .
the tubo submarino is much of steel recubierto of cement to protegerlo against the anclas of the ships .
supports in the fund the sea , to a per of 200 values of depth .
to construirlo , was necessary avoid camps of mines dating of the second war world .
&quot; was necessary fallen or destroy a centena of them , caution &quot; , jens müller , spokesman of the society nord stream .
also , was necessary providing the measures of protection of the parliament and the flora .
the tubo is a long word of metal pesa as 242 torres eiffel and not is cut in the their length : or válvulas , or stations of peacekeeping .
was due a platform of control in the water of sweden , but the responsible the project renunciaron to the same at see that the swedish not were very ready to allow that a society state russian estableciera of way permanent in the sea with to their coast .
&quot; in case of avería , interrumpiremos the step the gas in least of a minute &quot; , be jens müller .
in case of flight , the gas the pipeline liberará , therefore , to the atmosphere .
but the builders feel little likely that would a flight , since have proves junturas , according the forecasts , will a flight every 100.000 years .
the control the state the pipeline does by a robot submarino , arrastrado a per , do inspections external , as by a recording restrict the interior the pipeline .
with the way of a puro , introduces in the interior the tubo , has a distance of a metre , and seeing with the gas .
to their arrival , after three hours complete of journey to a speed of three metres second , supplies data precise on possible deformaciones the metal .
the pipeline has been representing to work for fifty years need of no kind of reparación .
the movement the gas does simply the pressure .
the principle is of 200 bars and , to the exit of 100 bars .
five companies have joined their forces to be carry to out this project .
the company leader is gazprom , has the 51 % of the cautiously .
to she , unieron the german e.on and basf ( 15,5 % every one ) , as the neerlandesa gasunie and the group french gdf suez ( 9 % every one ) .
these five societies have created a company common , called nord stream , encargada of build and exploiting the pipeline .
has their headquarters in zoug , switzerland , where the taxation is especially favourable .
after , gazprom alquiló to that society , for a term of how years renewable , the whole of the capacities of transport of gas .
&quot; to gazprom you paid the capacity total , regardless of the amount of gas really transport &quot; , be jens müller .
the funding of the construction the pipeline has taken just in a 30 % with the contribution of the accionistas and in a 70 % by loans banking .
the cost total of the labour should achieve 7.400 million of eur to the two tubos .
to gdf suez , example , the investment has reached the 240 million .
but the accionistas weaker are sure of that not superarán their investment , since gazprom moderating itself only the risk of the expenditure .
the pipeline emerge the baltic in lubmin , in a coast arenosa plantada of pinos .
a válvulas , with 4,5 metres of level , are the door of exit the gas .
there a sensors miden the pressure , the temperature and the characteristics specific the gas to the arrival , before of that owed to the pipelines german .
since the last tuesday , the terminal receives one million of metres cubic of gas russian every time .
to total capacity , will three million time and in 2012 , six million .
