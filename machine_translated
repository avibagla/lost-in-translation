How have been the prices of the travel from 1989
1989 had in the Czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state approves , , , and
The agencies of travel of who time Karlsbad in the majority of the cases travel only the block socialist , because the travel to West were very
The tourists Czechs you , by and , of holidays to the beaches of the ( Republic Democratic German , to the Union Soviet , ( Abkhazia, in in the Sea Black to Bulgaria and Romania ( both in the Sea Black and to Hungary (
A derogation positive was the period was between 1962 and , when could travel to Yugoslavia , without that , after the regime towards the west and the travel of the tourists Czechs were then quite
A great the for was the fact that to the citizens the block socialist ( or be , also to the not they travel free and or even by the countries socialist
If a citizen wanted travel , by example , to Poland or to the Union Soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the journey individual not was possible
The agencies of journey in those times also travel the reasonable , but one should to to the up with a make of in and to this all the night , or have good known in the agency
still this not all was cattle
The so-called promise of change that was the condition for the travel the reasonable , not had to the people politically little means , that this not could travel in no
The currency not was a currency freely and , without guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency Western for travel to West
The great majority of the Czechs experience their holidays in their own country , by what that had a great number of herds and houses of summer , that the Czechs This am still concern.
The way of travel of the Czechs has suffered from 1989 a genuine revolution
While that to 1989 for us was the not is more to the holidays in the or Bulgaria , the year last the Czechs did million of travel of holidays to countries of all the world
It great , of the that today day already not are aware , the fact of that the destination currently , Croatia , to 1989 not could travel freely , because was part of the Yugoslavia of then
principles of the years 90% causing the exemption. of visa for travel to the States neighbours of Europe Western , what that was a wave huge of visits of shorter is , to establishing or Germany
The , for a time , not basis of the the reasonable , all the world wanted it the what less by a time
example , in Paris the groups of Czechs in the (PAN). in shops of campaign , already that our income of then not we pay a hotel or pension
A feature humbug. of the Czechs of who time was the be those the food. ( significance , , etc., for save
Another time important was the introduction of the of the crown Czech , this our tourists could finally , after of decades , buy freely currency Western
Our level of life and with he also the wages means , what that around of 1997 was a increase in the demand of travel
With the increase of the demand of travel began the agencies , to from of 1997 with saying , to preparation the travel under the missing of flights , what that was down the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thank to the possibility of obtain by the volume of passengers
end of the 90% the century last , already the Czechs way without visa to almost all the countries developed , such USA , what which still more our travel
Another time interesting in the history the tourism under already in the 2000 , when was organised , thank to a huge demand , the first flight direct from to a country , and was to Thailand
Since who year , instrument. all the years flights direct with tourists Czechs was countries hordes and This winter already directly from to 12 Both
The countries the visiting currently to of 100 billion Czechs the year
Another time interesting of this time , that symbolises our development , was in the year 2008
The 17 of November of 2008 , USA the visa for the tourists Czechs , with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world
In 2008 the Czechs , by first time in their history , have last more of the half of their holidays in the abroad ( of and by first time in their history , have spent in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion around by head , including the expenditure in the to of they
House General for choose the President , that could end of new in point died
Since a almost five months the football Czech is without President and is likely that the successor of Safronov, as President of the Federation Czech of ( , not or after the call of the next House General that will place this Thursday in
fact , still not has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to to
the same , not will vote even for choose between the three candidates
The interested to Due the football Czech are , and
to their office in June not without before convene to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that for the football in the future
that , after of conclude the was , widespread, a controversy between the two entertainment of the partnership unable of to to a agreement for move a candidate common
This was in Something the 16 of September when had that be elected the new President
The is of the House General met in no in the a National ( , on in the area of , because the discussions had blocked and not only in As the method of election
not was to no consensus or in As to who in the House General had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the is with This powers
from of that time and because to this only point , The a agreement part-time , supported also by the recommendation the Institute of State and law. , according the which the representation by This powers not is possible
that , the disputes on the code electoral still open
More light on the situation already not could EU-Mexico or the Committee Executive that , in their meetings , or Mr , law not decided nothing
The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already , but the point - still the same
The question is the next What of what way proceed in the third round for avoid the point died
The dispute entire in about to if must proceed of agreement with the charter or find another model , says , one of the three of the , that , from the direction of the partnership , represents the professional
According the model proposed in the charter , in the third round who candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their forward
The region of returned is prepared to to to a compromise for that can earn who candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both entertainment
The part , without that , is the condition of that the election , according these somewhere , should have the majority of the less two were
This to , without that , the sense to the two thing previous and by completely the concept of system , this is as in the raised of the part , according what which what better would not You the order and vote according the charter Social
With what said , disconcertingly , is of agreement also , although is that the regulation electoral out by the charter of all the candidates it more to
I like that vote the maximum of agreement with the charter
that not no on of the representatives as in the last House General , says the on-line of Royal , that by first time as candidate and that being their remarks mainly in against of
still
According he , in Article on the new President and he believes that the candidates in the future of way constructive
All the with the party of today of our team national in the Cup European
The football haunt to be a , and this more to pleased that the representative the , that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , and to level professional as regional
is the more whatsoever
I that to to a agreement , but , by to , the situation is a more complex
not is the conflict between and , but there attempts of years. the rules to their own Ms
This can have as result a new being of the House General
all anyway. , I that Piñera the sense common , said
already not is a time for that all the parties day to a agreement
Some negotiations had that be in Montenegro , but What who can know to that it the party if the team of football will completely
The on special , in the that had that travel to region. , between other the and , not has this morning by problems technical in Prague , having that for a alternative for carry to part the committee an the place where will place the party of classification
the meeting decisive , by end , could be the that will place to level ministerial , that , according have , be this Wednesday
, Minister of Education , Youth and , to like a in to the parties divided to the organisation more powerful the country for that to to a agreement
There a in at the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next House General the Committee central of the federation the sport ( that single of a new direction the sport Czech after the problems financial of the house of advertisements
by to the was , because not is a candidate more appropriate
If the head of the of , , before of the House General extraordinary the name of a candidate appropriate that all their ideas on the new President of the Federation Czech of Service ( , or would as candidate to a it so issue
If have a person proper , would fighting by she and not I would as candidate to the elections
But to the day of today not has been find a person this , said for the Agency of Czech (
What that to to into in the challenge with and is exactly the possibility of to , the course election of the elections , that opens the way to the was of the Federation Czech of (
also that , in case , in the office of President only to 2013, , when the Question of the to general American
In that office to like see to a expert and good tortilla that not is too connected with the events
already I spoken with some people to the that could have in account
me was a madness hear to some say that in this time or even want identification with the football Czech
I like change that vision , they
What that is more have to in this time is the relationship of with the President of the Partnership of Service Regional of miraculous , a man with a last definition , known outside the as a with capacity of influence in the vote of the is in the to general
is so unacceptable see to his in the presidential
In case of that , the status which and nothing in the football will
With the support of , a man of business ambitious , the football Where still less to , said
also the fact of that a a years the name of was associated with a heard had for the research of a case of corruption , of the which went
not know what prestige the football could bring the victory of
And with what in we after the pull and the FIFA , said , that also decision-making with certain precautions their statement previous that the Club if become in President
In the case of earn the elections the Thursday , could be the cooperation with in the future
same opinion is the another candidate , , that has been supported by before of the House General of September that end in a
He ( would the first the that confinement
is very able
I what could imagine , by example , as head of the representation
but not as tortilla of a partnership
I not the there where not I feel able , Coventry. , that in September attention by support the suspension of the Commission of extremely by , may after by
admits that far to manage the partnership
to their it of management of the companies private , because from the summer last is also the Director-General the , that with their support was in May the in first division
I force for change some things in the area of football and help to their practice safe
reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably are to influence in the decisions the committee refunded and of court , taking situations , said without conceal their towards the President the Daniel
A of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the and the Committee , with the aid the which pressure on the leaders political for that does more money the sport of the tax of the time
is one of the problems key the that should devote the new President
If the tax on the for of gambling , as what the parties political , their arguments , but , I , have that successfully is to stop all this money , out
, now not has in account even their partnership with the Club , although he same that that the President of the must be not an
is to their time associated with and with of Prague
not is ideal
But not I sense the fact of hand should my actions the Club of to other person for then to there after a year and a , said
promised to the new charter that with the point died of the elections
Two days before of the House General of the Partnership of Service one of the candidates to the was , , promised that , in case of be elected , Coordinating that the would a new charter that definitely for could , in the future , the settlement in As the regulation electoral
The representative the is in As to the meeting of this Thursday in , and believes that the conflict involved, could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football
already before of the elections not carried in September , promised which , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in how funds
participate in the last minute in the last to general , by what that this should of two months to could go well for defend and to , in a context more will , their ideas on the management the football
The people of all the levels with the football already a a time and expected about this Thursday the new President
that has come the time of that someone the partnership , of the man that Not mainly with the Club of , but that worked in the and in the committee an of the Partnership
this reason , believes have enough experience for manage the football Czech
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that Hradčany in the time of Safronov,
Unfortunately, , in the House general of June were agreed the charter that not were so as all survive?
If certain interpretations , we a President already from September , emergency
much the the document more important of the Partnership as for gain to the is
If I chose President , I what counts, as a challenge staff and I willing to respond in case of that this
is a question of principles , without the which not we There , says
In , in theory , to not with their opponents
already in the last had your that was with , the that respects by their training in law. , aware of that their would also their first deputy
already was a time without provide to Thomas who , the opposite of , not He pawn with head
a more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes
attacks but were and people was imprisoned by the campaign electoral
that many of them on their real of , said to their Rosales, , that still faithful to the statements unannounced already in September
weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , from the competition more in to the over
This last should be of promotion the football
also , could all the food-related that have to cause of the as result the scandal of corruption the year last
immediately after I in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , for ensure that has enough money for all the football , said a two months to the the candidate of 46 years
then also promised that their nomination as President the football not no change staff of the workforce
should that about first the tasks of each because , said to where , after a long period of , reality, a understandable
despite of the scenarios current that to the next to general , he believes that the is not travel in no this Thursday to
If the only point of total will how vote in the third round , without doubt what overcome
The football needs credibility , the which will only if by end has a leader , still two days before of the working more decisive in their a of representative , still
promised , that under their leadership , the to work with feel
If in the quarter House General for elected the current deputy as new President of the Partnership of Service Czech , people and an
promised that , in case of be elected , hard
implement a change effectively. and to that the Member the committee an be responsible of each area the football
also committed to solve the case of the , improve the relations with the pull and the FIFA , to more money for the football and continue with the work on by the previous President Safronov,
As President , I like producing by completely the football
Since the contacts international with the pull and the FIFA to the selection , and by the football professional or the of young of performance
With this not I say that what would all only , said in a interview for the
I a player of team and I into the powers the committee an of such way that each Member can dedicated to a area
And tasks difficult for that the football can , in each one of these segments , to forward with a momentum
people this probably not to , because on. start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the other , Coventry.
As to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement , says that has considered the possibility of not they of new as candidate
all know , that work 20 hours
But I know that this will sense and that not be people behind of my that I – and to each step , mover this the for of their
Many people I has said that not I give by Source , because then by also the other
is of have faith for not leave this , without more , said
According say , to also continue the work that already began with
During these two years , end a great part the work that not I that now fact
There processes that had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not I like that someone the , announced concerned by the fact of that , if the another candidate , , the situation in the partnership could to to be such as was before of the time of
I I in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , not is able of to
did. of he is on all all that people that chair the football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected
I can blonde a lot of things , but not the fact of that I to favour of someone
I be aim
I to a football for all , because only this well all and not only the elected , said
rejects also the idea that only serious the President
Although some people trying is what opposite , I in mind to what maximum by returned
example , is time of think in the fact of into the second division in a part Czech and in other , whose winners to the first division
not If the situation current in the that we only three teams of returned , what that represents a problem for the players young , said
Although to the of the elections presidential , President the Club , not is of believe in their for of be elected
still feel have a strong support of the Federation Czech , the which I was as their deputy and that know that behind of me there successes clear , said , whose successes understand the savings of tens of million of billion of contracts , the negotiations of contracts and the negotiations on the law of the time
another side , is their part of blame in that the federation not is united
And while civilized. that is for to the confidence in the football Czech , as the another trading , , as a candidate strong that has something that offer the football
No can is that was a great work by the who year
In the case of that be elected , probably will what that already began Safronov, and not of way significant the workforce the staff in the purpose
not I use that to my favour , being this to their rival

The walls have in How the researchers you are looking in Facebook
Before of become in the new face of the extremist right in Europe , Anders was simply another kind that their points of a in line
The Monday , , who buried have made a takes in Norway in July , that He 77 dead , when to their first hearing legal public
While can have acted only , was far of be only in the had last the greater part the time that example to their attack with to their computer , with some of the million of that support to the groups of right-wing in networks social
After of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more on of these people
But , What how
- only you that into in Facebook
We we account of that not was so difficult to to them , says , author main of a report published recently on the populism digital European by the centre of studies British
The of information staff of Facebook is so , says , that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determining their characteristics prevalent, with a in scientific - the way that the sellers have state using for years
The team of found a million of stayed of the groups of right-wing in all Europe and then they help. , but in place of to a new on or product of children's , the help. to the users to complete a survey that on their level education , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future
At to to through of Facebook , and their colleagues were able of to to more of 000 supporters of 14 parties of extremist right in 11 countries European - all without to of the office
is a way new of to a research , says
Some of the results not are the all The The supporters in line of the groups of right-wing are to be young , men and by the immigration
that , in a kind of needed, , those that are their in line with the outside of line are more nature , more democratic and less violent that those that are behind of the screen the computer
The work of is only a example of how Facebook is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists
of research , researchers doctors and scientists political are using the to for to all , from problems of health to tendencies social such as people's in the I like , messages in the walls and these of state
With more of 800 million of users members a average of three parts of content the day , the of data of Facebook is power a rise of the research , much the number of work academics with the name the to in the title to almost a 800 of in the last five years
some researchers , the beauty of Facebook is that you to to to the people to the that not with a in the street
Before , when to people the Party National British , was very difficult
that go to through the party , and them never you allowed the access , says
Facebook your all that - you to them directly
Others say that the to could give a way of identify and to the problems of
A study recent made by the , of the University of and their colleagues , found that the students university that visited of their good. of in Facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that in silence on the issue
suggests that the his of the students , such as the region. , could control the to and intervene for help to a student that many these of state with their
not is treat a problem if not what is Conservative , said Dimitri , the of and director the Centre of Health , and Development the in the Institute of will of Seattle , said the Washington Post
We found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would diagnosed
Facebook also is constantly to their own population for obtain data
The trouble. of Data the to has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the Day. of St distributed , the I of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of National ( mainly using the information to the that can access - defenders of the freedom digital a a time that who that the to should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research
that , the users of Facebook know that the to they is monitor , they like or not - the slaughtering by power play the with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the to your information staff
But What what is when the users of Facebook are to be part of a survey that or even know
While that the researchers have guidelines well at on how had their data outside of line , in line is a free for all
not I that many of the users have have even in the fact of that a way could be this their profiles , says launched , a the of of London , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of Facebook of students
In what that to them , was only between them and their friends
Then is the question of the at
Even outside of line , not there guarantee of that a issue of research this completely honest
In Facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a such and of the messages the wall are truth
What that in Facebook and what that can outside of Facebook are two things completely different , says
is by that that , to despite of their years as way of the technology , believes that a and a still the best at of research that nobody can use
not there substitute. for into in the world real and about with the people real , says
The research social is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line

Policy energy
the facts must assert more that the dogmas.
If there a issue that not can treat having in account considerations of short long-term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy
The availability and the cost of the electricity have directly in the power and in the competitiveness of the companies
It appropriate that a am electoral be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear
The debate only will useful if EU-USA the whole of the consequences economic , social and environmental of the options proposals
The French must Party their opinion in facts objectives , in data
now that are million of people in the planet , the and demographic the additional of the demand power before of , to less that to a huge part of the population world of a element vital
At same time , be that population. the shortage each time greater of the resources production, for to taking electricity now , without forget the need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate , a issue that has disappeared the debate
The accident of not none of these parameters
that , Germany which one in their decision of on to the energy nuclear
That not is the case or of Belgium , that charges. the their to the need of find a source able of , or of Switzerland , that only has by aim building central of last generation
another side , Britain , Finland , Poland , Republic Czech , Netherlands, Netherlands , Sweden , South , China , India and Brazil , by quote some examples , still forward with determination with their projects
The States United , by their side , after decided add a unit to their road , the construction of a central p.m. after the accident of
If the model German , on in the renewable renewable , is in times as example , the reality is in against of such speech
The election of Berlin is to mean a the price of the electricity , a greater on energy by the need of gas from , in particular of Russia , a increase of the emissions of CO2 by the construction of central of gas and of coal
In a months , the effects harmful
must on the case of Denmark
of Europe in the sector , the which major the 30 of of their electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the the wind by this reason , their emissions of CO2 and the price of their electricity are , Czechoslovakia, , a 65 of and a 50 of more high that the average European
the opposite , thank to the have of our policy energy , our neighbours a up of electricity a 40 of higher to the of the homes French
While that in a economy needed the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the maintenance of the which industrial in the territory national , the companies French from of the electricity more professions, of Europe
that reason , any reduction significant of the energy nuclear would a strong are the price of the electricity , what that realism to the statements on the of our country and the defence of our power
is of a price that the great majority of the French refuse to pay and , of fact , not opposition by principle to that kind of energy , according show the polls
us that the policy energy of our country has lost building a sector industrial with jobs of work director and jobs
means to the export , it a yet of specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not
If France leave the energy nuclear , would the slaughtering of great part of these SMEs and the loss of the 6 million of EUR annual in exports French of equipment. and services nuclear
What What a designed for function Sixty years , when is to the like of their manufacturer
could the equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not is a source miracle of production of electricity , the as that not is a source
The development by part of of solutions with in emissions of CO2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the of raise of the sources of energy
In the case of the energy nuclear , is order to the maximum level of security
In France , have of a Palestinian of security that by a control at and as and on the central existing as on the construction of
Our teams , of León professionalism , are also countries, by the security
In a century , the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious
Only only one , the of , The in conditions large-scale average not was consequences or for the people or for the a environment
In Chernobyl , the accident due the involved the reactor and to a for human
In , some people seem forget that the accident due to two disasters natural of a the without unprecedented , that the death of tens of thousands of people
The sector nuclear of this accident , such as what was of the two previous
Thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and builders French and Germans , the is a involved able of an to such EU's
While what all the players accelerates, that want building a central , the for of their construction in would a great gift for the competitors of and , it that they would to free for on the leadership in the consolation. development the sector nuclear
It is and legitimate find the best options for our country , but would irresponsible to that the world, , the dogmas. and the being a debate so important for the situation economic , social and financial of our country
The immigration , What a burden or a opportunity for the economy
The policy of immigration implemented. by nuclear has been that from various points of a the of the services police , judicial and administrative were to the policy of figures , the EIB of this policy with the status of country of the rights human of France
More recently , is the harassment which of the students foreign the that has to the successes. , with the Minister of Interior ( experiments the newspaper the 23 of May of last that France not needs foreign , dramatic or
that , misery. time reviews from the point of a economic
The question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the am and the right
In the case of the right , Jacques the are in 1976 that unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with to of two million of workers immigrants , while that in the am , the Mr what Vice-President, displayed that France not can to office of all the misery the world in 1990
The only difference , the degree of a
In 2005 , and the am as the right the fear to the invasion the territory national by a a of Polish
both are , as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society French
The only difference is in the degree of a with the that which with on to the immigrants
In their programme , quotation. is to include , those that the will could the problem of the as
This idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is worth , but economically for very face
As as extent the economists and square in a in recent that welcomed the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( World and , May of 2011 , College, into , , is a will consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants
The limiting of the immigration it the growth and damages the employment
The fears of with the impact of the immigrants based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national , in particular to the little indicates , go for that reduce their wages
But the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well supplementary that substitutes of the workers national and are mainly for in sectors with lack of employment
The immigrants little indicates working in sectors that not by to workers national and the more indicates in sectors dynamic where the training not in the demand of staff
A effect positive on the wages
by same way that a would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of , the between national and immigrants leads that the arrival of these last welcome in the wages and the employment of the national
into in account what previous , that a increase the 1 of of the flows is a are of the wages real to long long-term of between a and a 0.9%? of
And , without have in account the fact of that the diversity that through the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ( is a great proportion of Nobel Americans and companies as Google , , , and Yahoo were founded by immigrants
The immigrants also are taxpayers saying to the systems social , it that through of average a 1 of the budget total in the countries European
The Organisation International the work estimated , by example , that in Germany a immigrant that to with a age of 30 years planned a contribution renovated ( income less expenditure of into EUR to the budgets public of average for all their life
At principle of their mandate , nuclear wanted go to find the points of growth that to with the tooth
They tooth , that to the immigrants , had exactly the effect
Europe invented the democracy , only to lack think in a democracy European
The democracy is a well , but also people's
The continent European should power of this already that , although invented in Athens a more of two billion years , to what long the century 20th has suffered the forget, of the War World , advocates , the Holocaust , the , but also to in Spain , to ensured in Portugal , the in Greece
Some perhaps celebrity, that , for that the democracy definitely on their enemies , would enough exercise the vote and the way more direct possible
We , from Rostopchine the , that was of something have
The suffrage. universal , although is of a condition necessary for the democracy , not is enough by only and even can become in a instrument of oppression , as said found the
not , the democracy requires a more a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , , solidarity economic and social , justice
The crisis that we in Europe is a crisis economic , but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic
The the referendum Greek had , to this on , a dual effect was the need of a return 'Arab of the sphere policy , but also the concern feeling of their failure , of their
must on this unexpected for
The truth is that the lines the with of the battle democratic currently have up and that , in many cases , the soldiers Republican already not making in the good sense
not gaining if at a succession of referendums national , side in role of the needs and of way
A signing in white the with European no or a the gap the hole undertone laurels! what options for the citizen exports!
not , not want to old-fashioned of effect , but a exercise common , of full right , hostage-taking: and an , of the options and the democracy , this time to at European
not there crisis in Greece , Italy , Spain , Portugal ( of fact , not where end the list , because only there a crisis , the crisis of Europe
The entire of Europe is the that to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , that the that their implosion. and their lack of solidarity
is the whole of Europe the that suffering a additional in the sphere international
We by the transfer of sovereignty to Europe , but is all Europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and , with she , each a of their nations
What more urgent is that the sovereignty popular unparalleled the the project European
Because only together be the European reduce the weight of their debts , despot of the markets and preparation their future by the investments
The exit of the crisis considerable decisions to at European that not be taken without a legitimacy democratic total , unless that be for the disaster
After have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialist and of Jacques Delors , all the world asking in the now a governance. economic European

But think in she without a greater integration policy and democratic , and without that be as such by the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new point died
We on a new stage of the construction European

The revolution about by interests not would enough
This lesson still applies
We building a Europe more integrated from the point of a economic
