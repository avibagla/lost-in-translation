menu daily of a child obeso : not desayuna and dinner analogues
more of a third of the children with age 25-to-30 between the 9 and 13 years have problems of obesity , where the obesity affects the 9 % of the population school and the obesity the 5 % .
the children overweight from in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life that not is healthy , according from of research current .
again to demonstrate what is the importance the environment where overall for a development healthy of the person , so as the models that serve of reference .
in the table , the children obsesos deplored , , example , of analogues the least with the twice of often that the children of families with weight normal .
for dinner , more the 19 % of the overweight had cenado potatoes fritas the day before the analysis , the which is linked the programme of prevention &apos; the obesity not is a casualidad &apos; .
in the families of children with obesity not there preparation of people sports , what which is applies to the majority of the families current , where only the 15 % of the children did that their parents , the least a time , week , are time for the exercise physical .
survey so to 900 children
the survey was to end the last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of education basic of whole liberec .
already was the second edition the programme of &apos; the obesity of not is a casualidad &apos; , that supports the company of sure health general and the company unilever .
to now , have participated in the project more of 12 billion children since the 4º to the 8º course .
a dieta appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors determinantes , that do decrease contribution the number of children with obesity and even obesity .
&apos; only the half of the children encuestados have answer that have five lunches joys according the regime : breakfast , lunch , food , merienda and dinner , that is a of the conditions terms for a dieta healthy &apos; , - one of the results of the survey .
without breakfast but with embutido for dinner
the specialists avisan of that , in a development healthy , are important , also , the details , that also have , as , example have a time set for the breakfast in family .
in liberec , not however , only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren desayunan to the same time .
in the majority of the families , each one desayuna only .
but what worst was be that in the 10 % of the who not desayuna nothing .
the breakfast is , without however , the basis of a dieta daily right .
the study shows that in the families of children overweight consume with many more often the insanas potatoes fritas .
almost all - regardless the weight - they to daily refrescos dulces ( 70 % ) .
, rule general do sport more the 40 % of the children encuestados , without however , pronounced their parents this result reduces to least of the half , only the 15 % .
fabrícate your dieta
the next stage the study posibilitó that the chavales elected ( 204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools ) creasen their own which to from of all the takeover possible according their tastes and views .
&apos; the entourage food of the children czech in age 25-to-30 between the 12 and 15 years , since the point of view of a food healthy , are very removed of what ideal . &apos;
between their food their are the pasta , the meat and the dulces
&apos; is on all alarming the popularity of the refrescos dulces &apos; , by in the report end the study .
as food main has the palma the pasta and you still of close the meat of subsiding .
virtually , the children reject always the legumbre and the their , the fish and the i is very under .
change to habits made
the same time , the study shows that the children are prepared to change their habits food if receive the information fair .
&apos; in the group of control of the participants in the study , that rellenaron the cuestionario after of end the programme of prevention &apos; the obesity not is a casualidad &apos; , was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy &apos; , urgency in the results the study .
is the attention , , example , what as to the refrescos dulces , where many children empezarían to preferir the water normal and aware .
the children also elegirían with more often in the cuestionario the meat of subsiding and the fish for the food main and restringirían the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of harina .
the estilista has of be also a good guillermo , maintain the professionals
in the article introductorio , how about the estilistas , already i quejé a little of that the lessons initial already were quite cargadas .
not had not idea of how would what .
conferences of three professionals the ramo , how he to - problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world the entertainment .
and will worst .
as more close are the examinations end , more information and tasks practices we aguardan
and although the course develops each saturday and sunday , already not be a alfiler .
we time we studied with the director , alena , ( in the course not there no man ) on how he to the woman that not has a simetría perfect .
and so is the great majority .
someone is cuellicorto , someone has a every estilizada without the curvas right and someone suffering obesity .
the estilista has of know arise ópticamente few shoulders anchos , alargar a bottleneck or recrear the curvas necessary
we have given certain noticed on how do i the body of women the kind of jennifer oxide , of pechos and caderas enormous but cintura close and the same time not vestirla of a way too desafiante
if , , example , the difference between the cintura and the caderas is so that the skirt or the trousers not adaptan , is the it done coser the least a paper of abkhazia extra to measure .
without doubt not arrepentirán , because the clothes that where perfectly is impagable .
with a skirt to measure relieved much better that with a that not for of get , levantarse , baila in the cintura , etc
the body estilizado can allow he clothes with pliegues , adornos , bordados or drapeados .
there certainly many types of information various and of bodies , so that i readjust of that have of whole the week for to order in my head whole this information .
and even so , i fear that with the task asignada , already i more that of too .
to each participant in the course you have allocated two famous , to the that must solutions two vestuarios : one for the day and another for the night .
there that have in account the aspect current , the lifestyle of fashionable that adecue to the person in question .
i has tocado &apos; he &apos; to miranda kerr , perhaps the conozcáis of the campaign of victoria &apos; &apos;s secret .
out , within , for me is much better that , , example , britney spears or christina aguilera , that recently will engordado few hundred 75-kilo ( , favour , have in account the excessive ) , or the jovencísima selena gómez .
the orange-coloured we that recortarlos of the weeklies or buscarlos in internet and imprimirlos , for after elaborarlos graphically .
the moodboard , that is as is the result completely , expressed also our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design gráfico .
is important also think in the part gráfica the estilismo .
the estilista , , therefore , not viste only physically , but that also taken , , example , of the pages of products in the weeklies ( of subjects specific , as trends , bolsos , coats , etc ) .
of all this we spoke the estilista and leather mauro kameník .
but all this already is for the sunday .
the estilista has of have a vision global .
the three invited specialists him the conference the saturday with information on all kind of bodies .
the estilista honza pokorný , the leather of fashionable jakub polanka and the fotógrafo of fashionable ben renč .
jakub we reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the estilista should saberle from party to this .
and a good estilista know work with a same prenda of he of forms various .
the variabilidad is , in this case , fundamental .
so , the as gabardina ( or as say in english , trench-coat ) can he to what chauvinism with vaqueros and camiseta , but also serves for he the body he with shoes of tacón and fotografiarlo as if it in reality a clothing .
or well enough arremangarla and higher the bottleneck for obtain a image completely different .
&apos; jugad with this &apos; , we stressed .
what that more valoro is the next council : &apos; for start to work , ago lack that first conozcáis all the rules &apos; .
&apos; then already &quot; romperlas &apos; , said jakub .
, end i is clear , what memorizamos all these keep , what being with what , , what , if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable we we results different .
that without about of the desfiles .
thank the fotógrafo ben , know that a estilista has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that to fotografiar .
so , for a history of fashionable that have ten pages ( , therefore , ten outfits ) , there that have splendid , lists for use , the least fifteen .
and also that the photos the clothes works in combination with other prendas , all them different to the that mines in the reality .
all this there that times in account to the time of solutions the outfit .
honza pokorný we assured that the image and the lifestyle neurodegenerative them alone , in many cases , the half the success .
enough look to madonna , that not is precisely a as extraordinary , but the image and the márquetin have fact of she a star world .
in liberec , , the time , not there still a trend clear to use the services of the estilistas .
to the - famous also what are pointless ( i mere my skills , my aspect physical not has so importance ) .
and when someone we pida our services , there that have in account that is very likely that we indiquen a stature very different to the their real ( less ) .
then only is guglear and physically if the weeklies the heart already have writing on the issue , if a certain celebridad has engordado / adelgazado , etc
the sunday , honza and mauro we insistieron in that the estilista not you enough orientarse in the fashionable , but that has that understand of outfit .
during their work , on all must communicate with the people to the that viste , , what that is fundamental be a good guillermo .
know appreciate to the people , not ago of least , is their views .
&apos; when a director you contrata for that you clasifiquéis the vestuario and what completéis with prendas fine , not &quot; catch and bath-water all what that had and say : &apos; huy what horror &apos; &apos; .
&apos; encontrad the least a couple of things that podáis ponderar and recommend for that someone the can to &apos; , says mauro .
he same also we was that all must caber in the so-called &apos; placovka &apos; , is say , the exchange of work .
this set around of the cintura and have there all the tools necessary .
are items as nail , as nail , quitapelusas , or imperdibles . there also balance of nailon ( that you serves the estilista during the session of photos of products such that bolsos or gorros ) , pinzas special of enganche of prendas , front , if this outside greater ( the alfileres and another kind of enganches not are permitidos , therefore could damage the fabric ) , or a game of remnant .
for not slogans in the usual pasiva and to something in practice , we learned to revestir the suela of the shoes .
even during the part-session of photos in the study , in a surface flat , could damage the suela and much more still the foreign .
and not did more that revestir and revestir .
not we play the shoes with the nail for not dañarlos , accident .
so that had that be very hábil .
mauro i has given a joy the who my work without reserves .
the truth is that not i are very well these skills .
this is only a small part of all the that we heard during all the end of week , in the second part the course .
already i i given account that commit the estilismo to level professional not is a way of rose-tinted , but i . exactly as what that fairly the people .
in need for speed : the run competing , whole america .
renders
a journey , in principle despreocupado , complicates to cause of a series of descuidos impropios of a journey routine during the time of morning .
in certain measure managed cover the expectations , but this not serves of nothing , if , in reality , not intended do nothing so .
the new over , to the that the title adds the run , adherents large expectations already before of their estreno .
prometía that would new aires to the former saga of to need for speed and , to result of what shown , even as a game that not should end being other time a gender of action without more .
also we we curiosos , know how einstein the scenes insertadas , where the like main falling the car and rolex , their own ordinary .
as often happen in the series of nfs , the results not an great thing regard to what that we those .
there to that can to , - , but in the cómputo total some points to cause of failures absurd , that already come apareciendo in the series since ago years .
in reality not can not blend errors , but that is more well of the desgana incomprehensible of the programadores .
the adventure starts very well .
you predictability in a history , whose leading , as , has certain problems personal ; for resolverlos , you offers participate in a career illegal , whole america .
you sentáis the volante in the at west , in st franz , and tardiness.&apos; mission is to the first to new york .
the idea is give something interesting .
the route into in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty to .
of this follows that each career has place , a route different and the stages are localizadas in different environments , that are quite various and interesting .
of that way , one not has not remotamente the that of that the game also always what same .
some of the environments are even agradables to the view , although the level technical the gráfico is equivalent the of evidence previous of the series .
, therefore , not is nothing the another world .
but the walk , the desert , the landscape otoñal or the high mountains covered of snow , a effect about very , .
also , the to diversifican of time in when , a element atípico .
so , , example , in the desert you encontráis a storm of bit that ever the visibility .
in change , in the mountains there that have care for that not you sepulte a avalancha .
according that , each a of the to is very well developed .
only there a couple of models , but with that enough .
during a time , intentáis adelantar to a amount of rival exigida ( what normal in a career classical ) , after tratáis of win time ( duel chauvinism cronometrado ) and then you expected a duel against a only adversario .
in half of all this even to sometimes the police , that not ago but obstruct still more the things .
the - are the landscape outside the car .
have animaciones interactivas when as , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and you.&apos; you that ayudarlo , always pulsando the botón fair in the time fair .
nothing complicated .
is surprising , without however , that has enough least landscape in the game of what that be wait ( in particular there only three ) .
but the result end is positive , because this element not a to be upsetting and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements that do that the game it more interesting .
the model of underlined still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous .
that want say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not can that that be bad .
if buscáis a simulación realistic , already &quot; to in other part .
but to a career by with quite action you appropriate quite this lifestyle of underlined , although we find something better between the games of the competition .
to here , all in order .
but the problems arise after of a true time .
to difference of what right of the models of underlined , already not happens what same with the collisions .
of games of this kind not be wait that recree deformaciones and collisions complicated , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not &quot; predict how reaccionará vuestro prosecution , with what which not all is in order .
is typical that , the do a adelantamiento very ajustado or able the prosecution with a traffic normal , so only has covered roces , but in other situations almost identical , vuestro prosecution has doing piruetas descontroladas .
or even has completely destroyed .
thank the system of reseteo , not arise large problems , but can poneros of bad humour .
the reseteos are programados of as way that , when sufres a accident or you sales of the back , the game you restituye the last point of rescue in the back .
without however , in each career only at of five reseteos available .
if the consumís all , you that restart the career since the principle .
so therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not will well , but not is very of fiar .
to sometimes , not the reseteo aid , only aid the aprenderse the stage is of memory .
a great disadvantage the game is that the ourselves facts are in different places .
in some curvas , , example , there that into of a way specific ; of another way , are being of take .
other sometimes you encontráis in some website vehicles &apos; civil &apos; always with the same configuration , although estéis the first , quintos or lleguéis five minutes before or after .
this ago of rabiar on all in situations , when veis that two autos that will the i in directions diametrically , your contrincante adelanta without problems , but when llegáis , debéis girar or well ruthless .
is as when lleguéis , because is programmed , that the &apos; surprise &apos; always will front of release narices .
the adversaries have also a advantage more .
during whole the starting llegaréis to websites where , without have in account the time , always you adelantará the same adversario in the same website .
also this happens the end of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is still more chocante .
vuestro oponente must to before that you.&apos; , the price that be .
when will front of you.&apos; , you difficult the vision of the autos that come of with , so that the principle &quot; do papilla the car .
can understand the idea of create a game with maximum takes of suspense and adrenalina , but the execution is so apparent that surely you decepcione delay .
and is a it , because although the model the journey be simple , the game is fun and with action , of way that to often not is possible continue the detail what that is not where .
and really . as , if the merit has the idea with fifty runway standardise or the classification in the career for that not quepa the platitude , or any other thing .
a idea inhabitual is the change of autos during the to .
you that be to to the surtidores of petrol the hand of the road , because exactly there you that change of prosecution , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you .
the autos into in three categories .
the sport are suitable for areas urban , the autos strong american for the motorways rectas and the exóticos superdeportivos for a underlined technical , , example , , roads of mountain with curvas .
also balance narrativo main also even a balance of challenges parallel , is say , there to in places specific that conoceréis , the stories .
here conseguiréis not only medals , but also points of experience for vuestro profile , that serves therefore for the challenges as the cuentos .
the achieve the level higher , the driver you open several possibilities , beginning , the prosecution and acabando with funds for the profile .
the same time , there conectada a role autolog in line , that preceding vuestros results with the of other players and disponibiliza other duties community .
one of the elements more difficult of understand is how is nation the last career in the history .
with the car llegáis to the tunnel the metre ( pass ) , where you ponéis to caused to shameful , the ways ( pass ) .
the velocímetro you mark between 150 and 200 km / h ( pass ) and , of suddenly , , behind you a the convoy the metre and you has , front without more .
in the significant surely we a discussion on this during several days , on if during the programming the game none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take , a buffoons of bobos .
the part technical the game not is nothing so , but the least the effects visuales general are in the majority of the cases agradables , to sometimes to soberbios .
therefore what it that , in the at more tensos reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a way serious .
this affects on all to the accidents where there involucrados many participants , when the quality of image continual already not is valid .
the audio is well and the bandwidth sonora is a question of tastes .
to end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth , the bandwidth sonora belongs to the category &apos; each one of their father and of their mother &apos; , but can mean that nobody well-informed the game only , their music .
the that end of need for speed : the run is therefore quite confused .
if the game evitase errors absolutely questioners , we we problems in that that the run is the better game of nfs of the last years .
. the that of that the game not is completed .
the diversión is asegurada , but preparaos because the errors you slap in the eyes with the force of few reflectores of airport .

how have – the prices of the travel since 1989
to 1989 had in the czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state you : Čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea and autoturist .
the agencies of travel of at time vendían in the majority of the cases travel only the bloc socialist , therefore the travel to west were very restringidos .
the tourists czech would , , therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the gdr ( republic democratic german ) , to the union soviet , ( sochi in crimea in the sea black ) to bulgaria and romania ( both in the sea black ) and to hungary ( balaton ) .
a exception positive was the period for between 1962 and 1972 , when could travel to yugoslavia , without however , after the regime yugoslavo inclinó towards the west and the travel of the tourists czech were then quite restringidos .
a great - the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc socialist ( or be , also to the checoeslovacos ) not them permitiese travel free and dreaming not even , the countries socialists .
if a citizen wanted travel dreaming , , example , to poland or to the union soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the journey individual not was possible .
the agencies of journey ofrecían in those times also travel the west , but one should to to the eu with a together of ball and to so whole the night , or have &apos; good known &apos; in the agency .
still so not all was won .
the so-called &apos; promise of change &apos; that was the condition for the travel the west , not concedía to the &apos; people politically little reliable &apos; , that so not could travel in all .
the currency checoslovaca not was a currency freely converted and , without guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency western ) for travel to west .
the great majority of the czech experience their holiday in their own country , , what that had a great number of infestation and houses of summer , that the czech adquirían . this preparation still still .
the way of travel of the czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution .
while that to 1989 for us was the not will more to the holiday in the gdr or bulgaria , the year last the czech did 4.5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world .
is nna great - , of the that today day already not we aware , the fact of that the destination currently odds-on , croatia , to 1989 not could travel freely , because was part of the yugoslavia of then .
to principles of the years 90 imposed the exemption of visa for travel to the states neighbours of europe western , what that was a wave huge of visits of short long-term , sobretodo to vienna or germany .
the checoeslovacos , during much time , not pretended hartos of the excursiones the west , all the world wanted see the what least , a time .
, example , in paris dormían the groups of czech in the parks in shops of campaign , already that our income of then not we permitían pay a hotel or pension .
a feature typical of the czech of at time was the be because the food ( canned , analogues , etc ) for save .
another time important was the introduction of the convertibilidad of the nickel czech , so our tourists were finally , after of decades , buy freely currency western .
our level of life aumentaba and with he also the wages media , what that around of 1997 was a increase in the demand of travel .
with the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies , to from of 1997 with regularly , to preparation the travel using the direct of flights chárter , what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thank to the possibility of obtain check-ups , the volume of passengers .
to end of the 90 the century last , already the czech found without visa to almost all the countries developed , thing us , what which simplificó still more our travel .
another time interesting in the history the tourism pos-revolucionario happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thank to a huge demand , the first flight direct since liberec to a country exótico , and was to thailand .
since at year , proceed all the years flights chárter direct with tourists czech was countries distant and calurosos . this winter already volará directly since liberec to 12 destinations exóticos .
the countries exóticos the their currently close of 100 billion czech the year .
another time interesting of this time , that symbolises our development pos-revolucionario , came in the year 2008 .
the 17 of november of 2008 , us squeezed the visa for the tourists czech , with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world .
in 2008 the czech , , first time in their history , have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50,3 % ) and , first time in their history , have spent in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion czech , head , including the expenditure in the website of stay .
tandare house general ordinary for choose the president , that could end of new in point died .
since ago almost five months the football czech is without president and is likely that the successor of ivan hašek as president of the federation czech of futbol ( faČr ) , not conocerá not after the call of the next house general extraordinary that will place this thursday in nymburk .
of fact , still not has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to continue .
without the same , not will vote even for choose between the three candidates .
the interested to presidir the football czech are jindřich rajchl , miroslav pelta and tomáš paclík .
hašek renunció to their office in june not without before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that supiese deals the football in the future .
without however , after of conclude the was hašek , used a controversy between the two federaciones of the partnership unable of to to a agreement for decisions a candidate common .
this became in obvious the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president .
the delegates of the house general met in vain in the home national ( národní dům ) , on in the area praguense of smíchov , because the discussions had blocked and not only in as the method of election .
not came to no consensus not in as to who in the house general had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the delegates with scrum powers .
to from of that time and because to this only point , in a agreement part-time , supported also , the recommendation the institute of state and right , according the which the representation , scrum powers not is possible .
without however , the disputes on the code electoral are open .
more light on the situation already not could should not the committee executive that , in their meetings , ordinarias or extraordinary , all not vihear nothing .
the opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the point - still being the same .
the question is the next : ? of what way proceed in the third round for avoid the point died ?
&apos; the dispute about in about to if must proceed of agreement with the estatutos or find another model &apos; , says dušan svoboda , one of the three vicepresidentes of the faČr , that , since the direction of the partnership , represents the futbol professional .
according the model proposed in the estatutos , in the third round going at candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy .
the region of moravia is ready to to to a compromise for that can win at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both federaciones .
the part bohemia , without however , which the condition of that the winner , according these are porcentuales , should have the majority of the least two thirds .
&apos; this you quitaría , without however , the sense to the two rounds previous and negaría , completely the concept of system bicameral &apos; , so is as svoboda understand the concerns of the part morava , according what which what better would not play the order and vote according the estatutos files .
with what said , surprisingly , is of agreement also tomaš paclík , although supposed that the regulation electoral established , the estatutos of all the candidates appropriate more to pelta .
&apos; i like that votara the maximum of agreement with the estatutos &apos; .
&apos; for that not inventen no tontería about of the representatives as in the last house general &apos; , says the you of victoria plzen , that postula , first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of pelta .
pelta still being positive .
according he , in nymburk decide on the new president and he believe that the candidates in the future cooperaran of way constructive .
&apos; all the pasiones apaciguarán with the party of today of our team national in the championship european .
&apos; the football will to be leading , and so cooperara more to their &apos; says the representative the jablonice , that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to level professional as regional .
rajchl is the more reluctant .
&apos; hope that when to a agreement , but , , unfortunately , the situation is much more is . &apos;
&apos; not is the conflict between bohemios and moravos , but there attempts of ajustar the rules to their own convenience . &apos;
&apos; this can have as result a new deadlock of the house general . &apos;
&apos; of all case , hope that band the sense common &apos; , said rajchl .
already not is much time for that all the parties come to a agreement .
some negotiations had that take in montenegro , but ? who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely ?
the air special , in the that had that travel to podgorica , between other the vicepresidentes dalibor kucera and rajchl , not has the this morning , problems technical in prague , taking that other a alternative for carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification .
quizas the meeting decisive , , end , could be the that will place to level ministerial , that , according have , will this wednesday .
to josef dobeš , minister of education , youth and sports , you like much integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country for that when to a agreement .
there much in game : the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next house general the committee central of the federation checoslovaca the sport ( Čstv ) that awareness made of a new direction the sport czech after the problems financial of the home of loterías sazka .
paclík luchará , achieve the presidency , because not is a candidate more appropriate .
if the head of the futbolistas of pilsen , tomaš paclik , before of the house general extraordinary conociera the name of a candidate appropriate that satisficiese all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football ( faČr ) , not would as candidate to a since so relevant .
&apos; if would a person appropriate , would fighting , she and not i would as candidate to the elections . &apos;
&apos; but to the day of today not has been find a person so &apos; , said paclík for the agency of news czech ( Čtk )
what that justifies to paclík to into in the challenge with miroslav pelta and henry rajchl is exactly the possibility of block to pelta , the course winner of the elections , that opens the way to the presidency of the federation czech of futbol ( faČr ) .
paclík also puntualiza that , in case through , permanecería in the office of president only to 2013 , when long-overdue the time of the house general ordinary .
in that office you like see to a expert and good managing that not is too related with the events fans .
&apos; already i spoken with some people to the that could have in account &apos; .
&apos; for me was a madness hear to some say that in this time not even want identify with the football czech . &apos;
&apos; i like change that vision &apos; , adds .
what that supposed more bother to paclík in this time is the relationship of pelta with the president of the partnership of football regional of pilsen pianist berbr , a man with a last controversial , known outside the mundillo as a poderoso lobista with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the house general .
for paclík is so unacceptable see to pelta at in the sillón presidential .
&apos; in case of that gane , nazarbayev the status existing and nothing in the football will &apos; .
&apos; with the support of berbra , a man of business ambitious , the football sorry still least from &apos; , said paclík .
mentions also the fact of that ago few years the name of pelta was e-commerce with a usual telephone during the research of a case of corruption , of the which pelta went impune .
&apos; not know what prestige the football could bring the victoria of pelta . &apos;
&apos; and with what eyes we peasant the uefa and the fifa &apos; , said paclík , that also decision-making with certain caution their declaration previous that &apos; vendería the club pilsen if pelta become in president &apos; .
in the case of win the elections the thursday , paclík could be the cooperation with pelta in the future .
of same opinion is the another candidate , rajchl , that has been supported , paclík before of the house general of september that end in a fiasco .
&apos; he ( pelta ) would the first the that solitary &apos; .
&apos; is very capable . &apos;
&apos; i what could imagine , , example , as head of the representation &apos; .
&apos; but not as managing of a partnership &apos; .
&apos; i not meto the narices there where not i i capable &apos; , added paclík , that in september suscitó many attention , support the from of the commission of Árbitros presidida , ludek macel , potential after , dagmar damkova .
paclík accepts that atrevería to manage the partnership .
particularly to their capacities of management of the companies private , therefore since the summer last is also the director the pilsen , that with their support took in may the triunfo in first division .
&apos; i force for change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe . &apos;
&apos; for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably tend to influence in the decisions the committee refunded and of appeal , have situations unpleasant , said paclík without so their antipatías towards the president the sparta daniel křetínský .
a of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the faČr and the committee olímpico czech , with the aid the which ejercía pressure on the leaders political for that socrates more money the sport of the tax of the i .
&apos; is one of the problems key the that should conducting the new president . &apos;
&apos; if aumentaran the tax on the games of gambling , as what anuncian the parties political , support their arguments , but , frankly , have that tell where will to stop all this money &apos; , out .
ademas , paclík now not has in account even their partnership with the club pilsner , although he same says that the president of the faČr must be &apos; not an &apos; .
pelta is to their time e-commerce with jablonec and rajchl with dukla of prague .
&apos; not is ideal . &apos;
&apos; but not i sense the fact of yield preach my actions the club of pilsen to other person for then to there after a year and half &apos; , said paclík .
pelta promised to the faČr new estatutos that acabarían with the point died of the elections .
two days before of the house general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency , miroslav pelt , promised that , in case of be elected , coordinating that the faČr had few new estatutos that sirvieran definitely for right , in the future , the controversy in as the regulation electoral .
the representative the jablonec is positive in as to the meeting of this thursday in nymburk , and believe that the conflict preelectoral could move towards a solution today with the possible victoria the team of football .
already before of the elections not made in september , pelta promised firstly , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in custom funds .
decided participate in the last minute in the last house general , , what that this be of two months you could go well for defend and present , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management the football .
&apos; the people of all the levels taken the football already ago much time and expected know this thursday the new president . &apos;
&apos; feel that has come the time of that someone gestione the partnership &apos; , think the man that couples mainly with the club of jablonice , but that worked in the sparta and in the committee executive of the partnership .
, this reason , believe have enough experience for manage the football czech .
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time of ivan hašek .
&apos; unfortunately , in the house general of june were adopted the estatutos that not were so lifts as all thought . &apos;
&apos; if excluimos certain interpretations , we a president already since september &apos; , warned pelta .
exactly the readaptación the document more important of the partnership aids usó as señuelo for who to the delegates .
&apos; if i eligen president , i what counts as a challenge personal and i now to to in case of that this falle . &apos;
&apos; is a question of principles , without the which not we there &apos; , says pelta .
also , in theory , to not over with their opponents .
already in the last had your that was mercy with henry rajchl , the that respects , their training in right , being aware of that their oponente would also their first vice-president .
already was much time without attack to he paclík who , the contrary of pelta , not he pawn with head .
&apos; has more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes . &apos;
&apos; their attacks but were vergonzosos and many people became amazed , the campaign electoral . &apos;
&apos; , that many of them dudan on their real nature &apos; , said to their maracaibo pelta , that still being faithful to the statements announced already in september .
their weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , since the &apos; more low to the with .
this last should be escaparate of promotion the football .
&apos; also , intentaría right all the escándalos that ems to cause of the bohemians as result the scandal of corruption the year last . &apos;
&apos; immediately after i involucraría in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , for ensure that has enough money for all the football &apos; , said ago two months to the Čtk the candidate of 46 years .
to continuation also promised that their appointment as president the football not comportaría no change personal of the plantilla .
&apos; would that know first the tasks of each he &apos; , said she to strahov where , after a long period of anarquía , has a nerviosismo comprehensible .
to despite of the scenarios at current that vaticinan to the next house general , he believe that the delegates not travel in vain this thursday to nymburk .
&apos; if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , without doubt what we overcome .
&apos; the football needs credibility , the which will only if , end has a leader &apos; , still two days before of the working more decisive in their career of representative , pelta still being positive .
rajchl enforce , that under their leadership , the faČr empezaría to work with wish .
if in the quarter house general its elected the current vice-president jindrich rajchl as new president of the partnership of football czech , many people will surely resentida .
rajchl enforce that , in case of be elected , trabajaría hard .
want implement a change systematic and do that the member the committee executive are responsible of each area the football dreaming .
also compromises to resolve the case of the bohemians , improve the relations with the uefa and the fifa , to more money for the football and continue with the work on , the previous president ivan hašek .
&apos; as president , i like commit , completely the football &apos; .
&apos; since the contacts international with the uefa and the fifa to the selection , happening , the football professional or the invariably of young futbolistas of high performance . &apos;
&apos; with this not i say that what would all only &apos; , said rajchl in a interview for the Čtk .
&apos; i a player of team and i gentleman the powers the committee executive of as way that each member can their to a area consolidated . &apos;
&apos; and asignaré tasks difficult for that the football can , in each one of these segmentos , continue forward with much momentum &apos; .
&apos; to many people this probably not you gustará , because busies start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others &apos; , added .
because to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement futbolístico , says that has have the possibility of not stand of new as candidate .
&apos; all know , that work 20 hours joys . &apos;
&apos; but need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that i – and obstaculizará to each step &apos; , he so the for of their indecisión .
&apos; many people i has said that not i asked , by , because then fico , vencidos also the others &apos; .
&apos; is of have faith for not leave so , without more &apos; , said .
according say , you justifies also continue the work that already began with hašek .
&apos; during these two years , end a great part the work that not i that now vanish &apos; .
&apos; there processes that had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not i like that someone the pare &apos; , announced concerned , the fact of that , if eligieran the another candidate , miroslav pelta , the situation in the partnership could to to be as as was before of the time of hašek .
&apos; i i in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , mirek pelta not is capable of keep .
&apos; behind of he is on all whole that people that ocuparía the football for that outside only a privileged for few few elected . &apos;
&apos; i can reprochar a lot of things , but not the fact of that i to favour of someone . &apos;
&apos; attempt be aim . &apos;
&apos; i do a football for all , because only so sentirán well all and not only the elected &apos; , said rajchl .
people also the idea that only serious karlsbad the president .
&apos; although some people trying that what contrary , i in mind do what maximum , moravia . &apos;
&apos; , example , is time of think in the fact of gentleman the second division in a part czech and in other morava , whose winners irían to the first division &apos; .
&apos; not would the situation current in the that we only three equipment of moravia , what that represents a problem for the players moravos young &apos; , said rajchl .
although to the pugna of the elections presidential sumó tomaš paclík , president the club pilsner , rajchl not is of believe in their possibilities of be elected .
&apos; still i have a strong support of the federation czech , the which i was as their vice-president and that know that behind of me there successes clear &apos; , said rajchl , whose successes understand the savings of . tens of million of billion of contracts desventajosos , the negotiations of contracts televisivos and the negotiations on the law of the i .
, another hand , recognised their part of fault in that the federation not is united .
and while civilized that pelta is &apos; descalificado for to the confidence in the football czech &apos; , as the another contravention , paclík , as a candidate strong that yes has something that give the football .
&apos; nobody can evident that was a great work , the pilsen at year &apos; .
&apos; in the case of that be elected , probably will what that already began ivan hašek and not cambiaria of way significantly the plantilla the personal in the committees . &apos;
&apos; not i use that to my favour &apos; , evalúa so to their rival rajchl .

this german of 46 years is a real supporter of the culture the one .
not want have nothing that see with the sport , says meder , only the water is different .
only you bother that the sports the one have that conformarse with azulejos blue and nostrils to chlorine , while that the sports to caused can breathe the fascinating after of the forests of abetos or listen the much trinos of the birds in the park .

for many germans of origin turkish which a fantasma that thought died ago time , since the attacks with way of fires in mölln in november of 1992 and in solingen in may of 1993 , not had happened more episodes of violence with background of extreme right against turks .
not however , never has questioned that in germany there xenophobia .
the network ultraderechista armagh reveals a magnitude whose dimensions not were , not much least , previsibles .
&apos; ? again to reavivarse the ideology bloody ? &apos; , titula the edition , internet the newspaper turkish &apos; haberturk &apos; .
the newspaper &apos; sabah &apos; resalta , the contrary that one of the authors the crime was a – of the office federal of defence of the constitution and shows concerned , that the authorities german can be involved in the pantanal ultraderechista .
the community turkish in germany reaccionó with sensatez , the end of week reminded to the victims of the violence racist with a vigilia to the door of brandenburgo .
two weeks before , the community turkish in berlin with with the political germans and turks reflexionaron in a act 10.30 the fifty anniversary the agreement turco-alemán .
the them it in scene with much colours , as a history with end happy .
the information came to some media turks as a bofetada : &apos; the gift german , the fifty anniversary &apos; , says the title of a article in the platform turkish of internet &apos; have x &apos; , she the background of the chain of for .
the emission german &apos; hürriyet &apos; not emphasises in out this connection mental .
&apos; beginning to nostrils bad &apos; , says the title of the spine of ahmet külahci .
resalta that the killed were people that pagaban their tax and did a important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of germany .
in the body of internet of germans of procedencia turkish , the behaviour of the police and their the success in the búsquedas discussing very self-criticism .
the authors asombran of that the authorities german not have buscado much before suspected in the non-inflationist of the ultraderecha .
at shows as least rhetorical in as to the drásticos media : &apos; to from of now here lose , to the immigrants not them is more that the self-defence and the arms &apos; .
&apos; this will the better autoprotección &apos; .
&apos; the peace internal of germany on are of the quality of the perverse and of the adequacy of the penalty to whole the network &apos; . , says &apos; selen &apos; .
what that means that , if the peace internal of germany is in danger , the attacks of mölln and solingen aclararán in nineties years .
the image of the ruins the fire of solingen has filmed in the 4x4 german and turkish .
no another skeletons was more clearly to the turks that live here that there a threat concrete and , to the germans , that the mistrust and the distance can desembocar in the violence .
the attacks agudizan the sense of group of the part turkish .
not repeat the errors the last
in the press turkish reputed then mainly the swathes of the policy german after the attacks , helmut kohl denies to visiting to the survivors of mölln .
after the attack with way of fire of solingen sent a telegrama of condolences the president turkish and klaus kinkel , their minister of affairs foreign , what sustituyó in the funeral of cologne . kinkel detalló in their speech what that contribute with the tax the turks of germany .
is clear how estimated the value of a person according the amount of their tax .
the information current of the media turks again to show what thorough that is , since then , the mistrust of many germans of origin turkish in the legality of this country .
also the effort of a explanation wider and of a revaloración the terrorism of extreme right in germany , this time do lack words francas .
the bank the scandal the lake of zurich
the bank more arriesgado of europe not is in italy not france , if not in switzerland .
the ubs almost she in bancarrota in the crisis financial and since then deslizó of a crisis to the next .
now the at a german .
sure that axel charisma not what had considered .
after of their witnessed starting of the summit the bank federal , in july through that in 2013 comenzaría in a new and almost also of witnessed work : president the council administrative the great bank blessing ubs , a inesperado and state step in their career .
axel charisma am should , commends switzerland , their beauty and to the ubs , their would acquired strength and is fall comments amables on their future colleagues .
&apos; the 4x4 has achieved a revival &apos; .
&apos; i am with with kaspar villiger and oswald grübel &apos; .
in september became clear that all would completely different .
a operators financial of the 4x4 in london blackout all the systems of security the bank and defraudó 1.7 billion million of eur .
oswald grübel , director general of the 4x4 , a banker not only known in switzerland , had that come .
the president the council administrative of the 4x4 was since then also tocado , and all asked : ? when a axel charisma ?
through that charisma must advise the bank since february of 2012 .
and will office of the presidency the council administrative in may , not to principles of 2013 , as the bank comunicó the tuesday .
this is hard for axel charisma .
not is banker , more well , professor of economy and consejero and has had a period of adjustment surely necessary .
of coup ago responsible of the strategy of a bank , that has of to to prove that deserves the title &apos; the greater bank the scandal of europe &apos; since ago time .
, a part , the 4x4 is huge , to ago little was the greater administrator of goods world , and , other part , since ago years , desliza of a scandal the next .
nothing , so what seems , you ahorra the changed so proud bank blessing .
started the crisis financial .
the 4x4 had a reputation excellent to 2007 .
the image the administrator of goods blessing discreto and hardest , but also mañoso , combinó with objectives ambitious , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investment .
, a part , with ones billion of dollars , the 4x4 variety more money of customers wealthiest that any another bank the world .
and , other part , avanzó as bank of investment in the league of the large banks the world .
this impresiona .
hans geiger , the former banker and the professor of banca in zurich during many years explains : &apos; to my students , always i described to the 4x4 as model of a good bank . &apos;
&apos; since the point of view current , one question : ? how could equivocarme ? &apos;
was in a great mistake .
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very bad in the 4x4 .
to middle of year , peter wuffli , director general , that to then was have as a banker genial and very intelligent , resigned surprisingly .
some months after , sospechó the reason .
the fund of investment the bank embarcó in losses with titles of high risk and had that amortizar thousands of million .
for should with this , the 4x4 announced a inyección of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of frf .
for this found investors , course that some miraran with contemptuous to little before : a fund state asian and opaco of singapore and a fund state arab , so discreto , that never had heard their name .
this was only the first coup .
in april of 2008 , empeoró .
the bank had that on the loss of thousands of million , marcel ospel , president the council administrative , in 2006 in the second better paid council administrative of switzerland , resigned .
in october of 2008 , she the disaster , in view of their investment wrong , the ubs found in the crisis financial to the collapse and had that be rescatada , the state .
the bank national compró values problem to the ubs , many thousands of million , the confederation helvética was six thousands of million of frf , a bono tests converted , by the that convertía in copropietaria the bank .
whole switzerland was affected , said what dramatic that was this for a country small , if aloja to banks so large .
finally the sum the balance of the ubs in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that the results economic of switzerland ( see gráfica ) .
&apos; not we to to rescue to the ubs &apos; , said geiger , expert in banca .
to the first disaster joined the second .
few months after , the ubs capituló in a conflict tax with america and was ready to limits the data of the customers wealthiest , that possibly had defraudado tax with aid the bank .
also , whereby a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars , reimbursed of profits injustificados of these business with a compensation , payment .
with this , the ubs confesó more or least have helped in the fraud tax .
simultaneously lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition , customers rich : the aureola of discretion .
after the scandal , the secret the bank blessing already not is the same .
to this continued the - the president of the junta directive and the president the council administrative .
and the emigration of the funds of the customers .
of this way , in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central : in the banca of investment by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax .
and fair when readjust to be something more relaxed , fair when i that the ubs readjust to this , is this desdichada history the operators , a operators individual defraudó 1.7 billion million of eur , before of that the bank diera account of that something was bad .
and desveló , , what seen , this still not works well with the management of risk in the banca of investment .
&apos; with the case adoboli to that the controls of risk have changed too little &apos; , says martin janssen , professor of economy and finance in the institute banking of the university of zurich .
the director financial of a great bank german also is sure : &apos; the problem of the ubs is that not dominates the controls of risk &apos; .
, what that about the idea of the caution , with the that the bankers swiss were since ago time , be the watch of the elderly goods the world : no risk too large , in change , the security the money want quebrar the another hand of the republic sanctity .
the deposits of security of the banks swiss were the symbol of the reliability inquebrantable , as lindt and sprüngli the chocolate genuine .
the central of the ubs in zurich not dovetails with the buzz the hardest bank private blessing , only is a little greater .
the situation is classical .
the bank has their the main in the street bahnhofstraße of zurich , that will since the station main directly the lake of zurich , enmarcado , the summits covered of snow of the mountains suizas .
here the buildings are ostentosos , the rented are few of the more higher of europe .
here are joyerías as tiffany`s between business traditional swiss as the confitería sprüngli .
here they since ago years the banks swiss : since the bank national , happening , the palacio of credit suisse , to the elitarios banks private as julius bär .
enter in the room of reception of the ubs by a disproportionately door chair .
within the walls are revestidas of mármol , front are large sillones of such , with the logo the bank there a great letrero for indicate the &apos; security &apos; .
the ubs know what that the client search here : security .
the two large banks swiss , the ubs and credit suisse , in some time have desplazado the idea the great bank blessing , or the have betrayed , as view the president of a small bank private blessing .
prefer not read their name in the newspaper , the end and the out ago , as all the bankers swiss , also with the business of both large banks .
the ubs has fact too large , view , mainly in the banca of investment , where the penal have won ground .
there the swiss not had nothing more that say .
&apos; and have have during much time to the our of the penal . &apos;
of fact , the ubs changed the banca of investment with , handed their first great proposed and then wine the disaster , no entity financial european had lost therefore money in the jungla the high risk as the great bank blessing .
the 15 of october of 2008 , the disaster was clear .
&apos; that wednesday the coalition government the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &apos; , says the author lukas hässig in their book &apos; de ubs-crash &apos; ( &apos; the crash of the ubs &apos; in spanish ) .
the political 3.8 to consolidated thousands of million of frf or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur for save the great bank of the bancarrota .
? how them happens ?
about with the bankers swiss , so are the problem in the dimension of the ubs .
in june of 1998 , two of the three large banks swiss fusionan in a poderoso consortium .
from a bank that , because to the merger , was too large for the small switzerland , and still growing .
, what that was for that the two different banks precursors of the ubs complementaran : a bank rico but fifty-year with the centre of the administration of goods in zurich and a internacionalización more poor but more strong .
of suddenly , the banks of investment internacionalizados came of way well with much money , with the that were do rodar a great bicycle financial .
there two names related with this takes of the ubs : peter wuffli , head the consortium of the ubs of 2001 to 2007 , and marcel ospel , then president the council administrative .
&apos; always thought that wuffli and ospel were a team perfect &apos; , says the expert in banca hans geiger .
&apos; wuffli , the intellectual , modest , that understand much of models and statistics , and ospel , the intuitivo that managed showed step since the learning in the bank to the summit . &apos;
finally , ospel fió of wuffli .
and the end wuffli was probably a mistake decisive : &apos; was that their models were a reality &apos; , says geiger .
&apos; is a case tragic . &apos;
tragic , perhaps .
is clear : the desatino came before the case .
the employees of the ubs remember clearly of the meetings of superiors , in the that wuffli , the head the consortium , always repetía the same motto : down the charles to goldman sachs .
the bank american was the bank of investment more poderoso the world .
encabezaban the &apos; league tables &apos; , the clasificaciones that then documentaban the success of the banks .
the ubs wanted be in the summit .
some steps you forthcoming well .
in the operations of divisas and in the negotiating of actions was in what more high .
without however , the advisers of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak : in the business the interest international , in the language of banca &apos; fixed income &apos; , there a compensation huge for the large banks .
the ubs has vacíos in the products hipotecarios american .
for fill these vacíos , the ubs started a adventure that almost you costs their existence .
Ávidos of growth , invirtieron therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investment american of high risk .
transformed in a machine powerful for titularizar appropriations hipotecarios american and venderlos to continuation , manteniendo certain risks to account own .
and also , as other banks at the bajada during much time .
&apos; in summer of 2007 , as the market estate american was in llamas , the ubs compró there &apos; , said geiger , expert in banca .
so large the euphoria , so thorough the fall .
a managing had that go , already that the attempt of one s more complicated of what that were .
the jobs in the ubs became in seats proyectables and are inseguros to the today .
currently , who at a great bank , has a work almost impossible .
must find a strategy for a bank , to the that all the models of business lógicos are stumbling .
geiger , expert in banks , has a idea , to end to the banca of investment , focus in the administration of goods , return to the roots suizas .
the bank not want to so far ( still ) .
but the banca of investment must decrease much , is clear currently .
the next thursday , sergio ermotti , the new president the bank , will their future strategy the world .
in reality , only was in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a solution abruzzo , already that the bank the bank separó surprisingly of their predecessor grübel .
meantime , he imposed : must to of way permanent the business of the ubs , comunicó the bank of zurich the tuesday .
ermotti want restore the bank of investment to their state to middle of the nineties .
obtain 3.500 jobs .
but this not enough .
the ubs needs a vision .
? who is ?
? with what want win money ?
these are the questions that sure ago axel charisma currently .
to the time only says that first buscará a housing with their woman in zurich .
the next year .

massacre to level personal
the nostrils and generous new book of peter englund , the beauty and the pain of the battle ( the beauty and the sorrow ) : a history íntima about of the first war world , &apos; beginning with a long dramatis personae the kind that can do that to one you caiga the soul to the feet .
i here some by of action : cold-start suavemente this website and conviértala in their mark pages .
will to know very well to these people in the narración novelística the mr englund , and this dramatis personae will as their gps , a faro during these few at in the that , as one of their men and women , is confusing and desamparado in the fog of the war .
the mr englund is a at and journalist swedish .
also is the new secretary permanent of the academy swedish , that underlined the prize nobel of literature .
what that has writing here is a book little aware , that describes , rightly , as &apos; a work of anti-historia &apos; .
contains some names triumphs , treaties important or frugal battles ; virtually not there ambassadors , elegant journalists or further on non-nuclear or material .
not is therefore a book about of what happened , explains , as &apos; a book about of how happened &apos; . is about of &apos; feelings , from , experiences and states of humour &apos; .
&apos; the beauty and the pain of the battle &apos; being the experiences in times of war of more or least 20 men and women ordinarias , to both both of the war , since colegialas and botánicos to escaladores , doctors , drivers of ambulance and administrative .
some of these people convertirán in heroes .
some convertirán in prisoners of war , or than their member , will belmarsh or morirán .
their lives parpadean here as velas votivas encendidas in a church ; few new add to the a while other go .
the book the mr englund is a deviating of the books of history standard .
is also a correctivo to the notion of that the first war world only was the funesta war of trincheras in the with western .
&apos; the beauty and the pain of the battle &apos; at of way skilled to through of other teatros of war : the alps , the balkans , the with eastern , mesopotamia , africa the this .
to the soldiers in this book them give above the colmenas ; one is the christmas in egypt under the pirámides ; the nut tsetse are a problem intratable .
this is a book conmovedor , almost since the start .
the war inunda the lives of these people as a disaster natural , a hurricane katrina that apesta to cordita .
when the ceasefire of artillery as in the distance , and you a woman that is in home with your children , ? you quedas or huyes ?
of all forms ? who next ?
almost nobody understand what that is happening , not even , what has that fight this war .
&apos; we of facts &apos; , noted the mr englund , &apos; has rellenado with conjeturas , suposiciones , hopes , scares , ideas fixed , bilbao of the conspiración , dreams , pesadillas and questioned &apos; .
&apos; the beauty and the pain of the battle &apos; still to individuals as florence farmborough , a juliet english in the army russian , and richard stumpf , a young marinero german of the fleet of high sea .
their stories have successful in their greater part of 4x4 , letters and another material already published before .
the explanations of their lives can be aterradoras or conmovedoras , but are more vaults of life in the accumulation of small at , details stumbling , the mr englund .
many of these are about of privaciones and of bust with what that there .
about of have the history of a colegiala german says : &apos; sucedáneos , , all parties sucedáneos &apos; .
&apos; sucedáneo of coffee , high-voltage untrue , plastic of imitation , vendas of role , botones of wood . &apos;
continues talking of the food sucedánea in germany .
describes &apos; meat nation to from of rice cocido and prensado in blubber of 02 ( and rematado with a hueso untrue fact of wood ) ; tobacco fact of roots and peladuras of potatoes dry ; shoes with suelas of wood &apos; .
there , noted , &apos; 837 substitutes permitidos of the meat in the production of salchichas , 511 substitutes the coffee registered &apos; .
some stories are about the honour and the value .
a american recognised their own momentum towards the who and to about of the war : &apos; sientes that , after of all , this is for what that the men are designed and not for drawing in sillones with a cigarro and a moonshine , the newspaper of the later or a &apos; seller , and removing that that paints means civilisation and that not there a barbarian behind of that pechera almidonada and tachonada . &apos;
in change a soldier british . account of that probably morirá , and of that nobody enterará or you importará .
&apos; a time that one resigna the thinking of sacrificarse , to one you like think that could post-gaddafi front the public &apos; , says .
in change , is horriblemente &apos; &apos; to a condemned being estrangulado in secret &apos; .
other comments are about of a old europe builds , and about of new types of terror .
&apos; the conflict has become each time more in a competition economic &apos; , says the mr englund , &apos; a war between factories &apos; .
however the arrival of what that he is &apos; a new kind in the bestiario the young century : the murderer in mass elocuente and convinced ideológicamente with ropas of good textiles that executes their fighters while is at behind of a escritorio &apos; .
the people means of ways imprevistas ; there therefore behaviour innoble as heroico .
the mr englund about of the soldiers that us actively catch a disease venérea of prostitutes as way of evade the service in the with .
&apos; the expression more non-combatant of this can see the trade of relative gonocócico , that the soldiers buy and embadurnan with this their genitales with the hope of end in the hospital &apos; , says .
&apos; those that are truly desperate what frotan on their eyes , what that to often . place to a ceguera of , life . &apos;
in this translation the swedish nation , peter serious , the prosa the mr englund ágil but not extravagante , is perfectly adaptada to their task human .
in dozens of small scenes however the way in the that the war to &apos; up forces excepcionalmente incontrolables : nationalism extreme , revolution social , hatred religious &apos; .
the people starts to ask , what their leaders them are doing combat .
the best books about of the first war world to often have been indirectos , as the great war and the memory modern of paul fussell , or novelas as without - in the with of erich maría remarque , in time of stories integrales .
the volume the mr englund unite to a pantheon little conventional .
their book has one of the end more beside that i remember in a labour of not fiction .
not what revelaré .
but is as if would come since their book , arrancado of between your it that website of dramatis personae , and the would planted with a cerilla .

the union of workers of support demandará to the city , the redundancies
the union that represents to hundreds of workers of support school that lost their jobs the month last last-minute exceeding to the city the wednesday , &quot; that the redundancies were plain and deplored because to their impact desproporcionado on the schools that atienden to students poor .
the demand is , possibly , the last weapon to available the union , the district municipal 37 , in their effort , revocar the redundancies .
seiscientos seventy and two vacancies of the school , the coordinators of parents and other employees that were between the worst paid of the city lost their work the 7 of october , in a movement that the leaders trade have to as a venganza policy , their negative to allow , the spring last , the access , part of the city to a fund of assistance health to office of groups of work for close their gap budgetary .
the authorities municipal have denied categorically that prosecution .
in a hearing in the city the month last , the consejero of education , dennis gijs walcott , said that the redundancies were a part the budget approved in june .
a member the council contraatacó him that nothing in the budget especificaba that the member the personal of support of the school would dismissed .
officials the district municipal 37 said that tabled the complaint , writing , advirtiendo the department of education of that would scrutiny . will a conference of press the wednesday for announced the presentation official of the demand , in the court supreme state in manhattan .
the demand include the mr walcott and the department of education of the city as accused , and account with eight workers dismissed as advice , all them women blackest or latinas , the as that the majority of the assistants that lost their jobs .
elizabeth he , spokesman the department legal of the city , said that the city not had seen the demand and , what therefore not could do comments on their claims specific .
according a draft of the demand successful , the new york times , the union has focused in the number of redundancies in the schools of areas poor of the city for support a complaint , treatment unfair , saying that the schools poor lost more assistants , already that had been insuficientemente contrary of way of .
out that if well not there redundancies in staten island and few few redundancies in the schools in the upper dundalk side or tribeca , 17 assistants schoolchildren lost their jobs in the district 23 in brownsville , brooklyn , and 46 were dismissed in the districts 8 and 9 in the southern the bronx .
taking in account the loss of five of the eight assistants employees , the school public 36 in harlem , where the consolidated , % of the students live in the poverty , the demand says , &apos; this not is a area of parents wealthiest that be custom funds for cover the deficit budgetary &apos; .
p.d. the budget the district 36 reduced in a 3,26 , % this year , and also lost money when the city changed the way in that estimated the funding additional for each abolition , student poor in the schools .
the union also says that the directors of schools imperative can have been deceived , the language in a memorándum that authorises the learn of the coordinators of parents .
the memorándum his the word &apos; surplus &apos; for under the action , to despite of that &apos; surplus &apos; describes with greater often the act of enterprises to a proxy of the nómina of a school to a exchange of work , whose just are paid , the office central .
&apos; sixty and six coordinators of parents were dismissed &apos; , says the draft of the complaint , &apos; and not only in surplus &apos; .
mission despite , the congress prepared for to to a agreement on libya
seems that finally republicans and democrats in the capitolio are prepared to only of agreement on something related with the embargo in libya .
all what that needed was that the which had success , that the contractor dictator muamar the gaddafi outside bombing and murdered and the participation of states united came to their end .
the tuesday , the committee of affairs foreign the senate will to consider a resolution , patrocinada , the president john kerry ( democrat , massachusetts ) , with with the senadores john mccain ( republicano , coldest ) and wresinski i. lieberman ( independent , connecticut ) , aplaudiendo to the who , their successful which and to the troops of us , their &apos; courage &apos; .
&apos; this resolution is for honrar to the valientes of libya , the start to rebuild their country &apos; , said kerry .
&apos; is a claim of support bipartidista for their aspirations democratic . &apos;
the language can appear inofensivo , but nothing on the debate on libya has been easy to now .
this summer , the legislators of both parties peleaban between yes and with the home white on the significant of a series of resolutions for approve or reject the role of the military of us in the mission of the nato in libya .
in june , kerry and mccain tabled a resolution that authorises the use limited of forces military of us in libya .
the project of law was derrotado in the house , a broader for bipartidista , and that never came to votarse in the senate .
but the same day in that the project of law was rejected in the house , the house also rejected a measure that would recortado the funds for the operations americans in libya .
what he the mission of us in a kind of purgatory legislative - with the congress what enough upsetting as for criticise the within , part of obama of the mission , but not so enfadado as for in reality segar the hierba under their feet .
to continuation , the indecisión the congress was superada , the events .
trípoli fell in hands of the rebels who in august , and gaddafi was murdered the 20 of october .
the mission of the nato end official the 31 of october .
now the senate could be completed for act .
the resolution the committee of affairs foreign &apos; welcomes the people of libya , their tremendo courage and extraordinary resistance for shake to yes ourselves &apos; and &apos; commends to the men and women of the forces armed of states united and to their partners of the coalition that took in operations military for protect the people of libya , their extraordinary courage and professionalism &apos; .
the resolution also &apos; states the interest national of the states united in a successful and multi-year transition towards the democracy in libya . &apos;
? going the new measure the completely support of the commission of affairs foreign , or dividirá to the legislators as was the project of law of june ?
the last version was rejected , the senator richard g. place ( indiana ) , the main republicano the committee .
the spokesman of place said the monday that not had seen still the version end the new project of law .
the another hand the capitolio , the house will to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget well-balanced , a priority legislative for almost all the congresistas republicans and some democrats .
the measure , patrocinada , the republicano bob goodlatte ( republicano , virginia ) , will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another issue that of fact logre a vote of whole the house in the house or the senate in this congress .
other legislators not have had success to the time for do to their amendments to the house , but not , lack of attempts .
the of goodlatte is only a of the consolidated amendments constitutional that have wonderful in this congress , that abarcan a wider range of subjects .
some are duplicados - the same project of law proposes therefore in the house as in the senate - and other with small compensatory between yes .
there , what least 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the house , and another handful that &apos; be the expenditure federal . &apos;
some of these projects of law also are idénticos between yes , but are to their patrocinadores - on all republicans job that looking refinar their currículums - the opportunity of jactarse of that them were the &apos; authors &apos; of this measure .
the law of control of budget , that was adopted in august , requirió that therefore the house as the senate voted a amendment the balance budgetary .
in march , 58 senadores voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of that amendment .
more beyond the budget , several member want limit the number of mandatos that the member the congress can to , while that the representative josé coli serrano ( democrat , new york ) , want validity the limit of two mandatos for the presidents .
the representative jesse l. jackson jr . ( democrat , illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments that an the right to a education of quality and attention health , between other subjects .
a amendment that prohibits the marriage homosexual is a proposal perenne , so as a that prohibits the burning of flags .
some legislators also want allow the written-off of the laws federal if are been , two thirds of the states .
so enthusiasts that have been the member to the time of propose amendments , not are strings to a pace more quickly that in years previous .
in the 111º congress , the legislators proposed 77 amendments , and tabled 66 in the 110º .
the pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the the of 1990 , when the member were regularly more of 150 amendments each two years , according figures proporcionadas , the library the senate .

the troops do feel more lástima that respect
the event was a by of wall street that recaudó million of dollars for the veteranos without home in new york .
kid loosening sung a balada on the of , the frustration and the loss .
in that time , several hundreds of soldiers , sailors , aviadores and infantes of marina medellín in their jobs in about to he .
the a of though it of ordinary and aplaudieron .
&apos; the men and women were who as heroes &apos; , said david saltzman , who organised the - of funds of spring .
a official military of high senior in the by , also known as the then president the state greater whole , the almirante mike mullen , was the role of the troops of way different .
&apos; the were as a kind of child huérfano &apos; , wrote the official in a e-mail electronic .
i sure of that the organizers they good intentions .
that the they .
but not was respect , of truth . was lástima .
the from marcadamente contradictory paddington the difficult relationship that has helplessness of the military and a public us to often distante , to sometimes , adorador .
prodiga to the troops with praise , their handouts .
but the alabanza has a price , say the member the service .
the public each time more it as if you dieran it those uniformados .
&apos; not we victims in all &apos; , said the general of brigade are b. macfarland , who comandó the troops in iraq and soon partirá towards afghanistan .
&apos; but seems that the only way of that some demonstrate their support is put to us in the role of souls desamparadas . &apos;
the issue is a issue very sensitive for the leaders military , that not want appear desagradecidos or in disagreement with the public the that serve .
also are account of that the ira to the that enfrentaron the troops that were in the last years of the war of vietnam was much worst .
as result , the majority of the discussions on the lástima for to out in silence and in private between the veteranos of war .
after of that their two children were of combat with the infantería of marina , the colonel withdrawn mark cancian them warned of that the people apart of the military considered their service since two prospects .

during their search of employment , said , felt that some entrevistadores you had was sutilmente if would capable of aguantar under the pressure of a assignment work of washington immediately after of their about of combat .
&apos; when hablas about of your service , necesitas do with to the from negative &apos; , reminded cancian contándoselo to their children .
from the concern military , in part , of the fighters us towards the wars .
the achievements in the field of battle are rarely time elected for the alabanza , part of a country that has little familiaridad with the military and is few profits direct of the wars of iraq and afghanistan .
&apos; us , as nation , already not we the heroísmo military of ways that were the all common in the second war world &apos; , said the messages general withdrawn david barno , who comandó the troops of us in afghanistan .

the department of defence refused to do comments for this article .
the things have changed since the years 50 .
while that to the women still them is official banned serve in combat , this distinction is only roll : the wars modern rarely time have clear the lines the with .
therefore in iraq as in afghanistan , the equipment of women soldier are desempeñando all each time more important , especially for to to the women local in areas of war .
the result : between these two wars , 150 women soldier have died and two thirds of them in situations of combat .
is time of that the army also modernice , says burke .

without however , the subjected are contribution infra denunciadas , and , the own estimates the pentagon , that figure in approximately the 13.5 , % of the 19000 incidents ladies that there that year .
the report , published in march , also distribution the best-read of prosecution : in 2010 , a 20 , % of the cases denunciados in the army was to trial - the half that in the system of justice civil .
the advice in the case of burke , describen their attacks as only the first of a series of there .

what that interpone between them and a verdict is this announcement that has been criticada since that published , first time .
i been a critical permanent of the announcement feres .
the army is decades , behind because not has the same incentive and deterrent that with the responsibility .
and adds : &apos; the back are are in against of them ... but is important for them try . &apos;
these things only period when the people good is ready to fight .
if the hearing not will , their way , burke , who of the advice , will to the eu to their other hundreds of advice for cases future .
&apos; we to continue fighting against the army in this issue to that the reform would &apos; , says .
&apos; or to that we muramos , what that happen first .
the walls have eyes : how the researchers you are looking in facebook
before of become in the new face of the extreme right in europe , anders behring breivik was simply another kind that aireaba their points of view anti-inmigración in line .
the monday , breivik , who befriended have done a killing in norway in july , that he 77 dead , &apos; to their first hearing legal public .
while breivik can have action only , was far of be only in the ciberespacio : had last the greater part the time that concertation to their attack with to their computer , charlando with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in networks social .
after of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people .
but , ? how encontrarlas ?
easy - only you that into in facebook .
&apos; we we account of that not was so difficult to to them &apos; , says jamie bartlett , author main of a report published recently on the populism digital european , the centre of studies british let .
the alijo of information personal of facebook is so enciclopédico , says bartlett , that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determine their characteristics demográficas deseadas with a precision scientific - the way that the sellers have state being during years .
the team of bartlett found half million of fan of the groups of right in whole europe and then them dirigieron announcements , but in place of vincularles to a new bandwidth or product of dieta , the announcements invitaban to the users to complete a survey that he on their level education , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future .
the to to through of facebook , bartlett and their colleagues were able of to to more of 000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries european - all without out of the office .
&apos; is a way completely new of do a research &apos; , says bartlett .
some of the results not are the all surprising : the supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young , men and enfadados , the immigration .
without however , in a kind of issuing , &apos; those that combined their activismo in line with the activismo outside of line are more reasonable , more democratic and least violent that those that remain behind of the screen the computer &apos; .
the work of let is only a example of how facebook is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists .
centres of research , researchers doctors and scientists political are being the website for to all , since problems of health to trends social as as &apos;s in the &apos; i like &apos; , messages in the walls and dialogues of state .
with more of 800 million of users active agregando a average of three parts of content the day , the &apos; supernova of data &apos; of facebook is formers a booming of the research , pushing the number of jobs academic with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years .
for some researchers , the beauty of facebook is that you allows to to the people to the that not podías acercarte with a carpeta in the street .
&apos; before , when intentabas encuestar to people the party national british , was very difficult identificarlos . &apos;
&apos; tendrías that go to through the party , and them never you 10.6 the access &apos; , says bartlett .
&apos; facebook would all that - you to them directly . &apos;
other say that the website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of salud-social .
a study recent done , the doctora megan seaside , of the university of wisconsin-madison and their colleagues , found that the students it that they of their hazañas of borrachera in facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that refused in silence on the issue .
seaside suggests that the colleagues of the students , such as the dispatches residenciales , could control the website and intervene for help to a student that it too dialogues of state with their binge .
&apos; not you try a problem if not what you diagnosticar &apos; , said , christakis , the co-autor of seaside and director the centre of health , behaviour and development the child in the institute of research child of seattle , said the washington post .
&apos; we found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would diagnosticados . &apos;
facebook also is constantly &apos; pinchando &apos; to their own population for obtain data .
the team of data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of st on , the expectation of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of Škottová national ( mainly being the information to the that can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago much time that maintain that the website should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research ) .
without however , the users of facebook know that the website them is looking , them like or not - the sacrificio , power playing the scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website mine your information personal .
but ? what is when the users of facebook spend to be part of a survey that not even know ?
while that the researchers have guidelines well defined on how up their data outside of line , in line is a barra free for all .
&apos; not i that many of the users have considered even in the fact of that a researchers could be examining their profiles &apos; , says voyager selwyn , a todd the laboratory of knowledge of london , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of facebook of students .
&apos; in what that to them precise , was only between them and their friends . &apos;
then is the question of the methodology .
even outside of line , not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest .
in facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the wall are truth .
&apos; what that dices in facebook and what that pensioner outside of facebook are two things completely different &apos; , says selwyn .
is , that that , to despite of their years as researchers of the technology , selwyn believe that a sujetapapeles and a bolígrafo are being the best tools of research that nobody can use .
&apos; not there substitute for into in the world real and about with the people real &apos; , says .
&apos; the research social supposed that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line . &apos;
&apos; cold and inhuman : anders behring breivik ago their first emergence public in the court
anders behring breivik , the man that confesó be the which of the two attacks that were to 77 people in norway this summer , has to to yes same as a combatiente of the &apos; resistance &apos; during their first emergence public in the court of oslo .
&apos; i a commander military in the movement of resistance norwegian and in the gentlemen templarios of norway &apos; , said to a room full with 500 people .
&apos; i am the court , already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology the hatred and because supports the multiculturalismo . &apos;
&apos; i the facts but not i adjourned guilty . &apos;
the judge torkjel nesheim was to breivik during that monólogo , because &apos; not wanted to to breivik the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that exprese their points of view &apos; .
, the same reason refused to allow to breivik , that brought a speech writing with diagnosed , address to the family of their victims the end of the hearing .
nesheim also seizure to the police keep to breivik under custody during 12 weeks more , you faiths the access to the media of communication during four weeks , and said that the authorities should that have a narrower control on all the visits and the correspondencia during eight weeks .
around of 30 survivors and family of the victims speakers to the hearing .
some came with the hope of look to breivik to the eyes , other for confirm that is recluido under key .
all speakers with the aim of move towards the conclusion .
&apos; thought that seemed cold and inhuman &apos; , said a superviviente of utoya to the outlet ​ ​ norway nrk .
&apos; was you , but for me was a step forward after of see and hear the suspect . &apos;
clothing with a suit dark and shirt blue , breivik remained calmado and professional to what long of the hearing and miró to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when she and went the building .
to despite of the strange notion of breivik of be part of a movement of &apos; resistance &apos; greater , the judge determinó that not is a ill mental , and said that not there evidence of that act with cómplices .
is possible that to some them consuele that the attacks the 22 of july unimaginable be labour of a extremista in place of a group of radical .
but that not suaviza automatically the pain and the confusion that whole a nation still feel .
&apos; i like that prompt a monster , but not what seems &apos; , said a family of a victim .
&apos; would much more easy if what prompt . &apos;
7 lessons of the interview delayed of steve jobs , show in a theatre this week
after the death of steve jobs , the 5 of october , there some that what compararon with henry ford - distinguiendo the out of the technology as the great inventor modern .
but what that the fan of apple could find more demonstrates , in a interview to jobs recently redescubierta to the that has desempolvado as embargo of a series of proyecciones special in the elderly markets this week , is how about this mind creativa about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products .
was without doubt a leather , soñador and hippie autorreconocido , but also was a inflated meticuloso and a yonki of the diagramas of flow - a man that thought that many place sufrían &apos; a disease that is in think that a great idea is the 90 , % the work ... &apos; but &apos; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product . &apos;
in 1995 , bob cringely was developing the series of television the triumph of the nerds ( the triunfo of the idiotas ) on the albores the computer personal , and sit during more of a time with jobs for a can and rarely conversation .
in that time had last barely 10 years since that jobs had been forced to leave of apple , and already working turn in their new company it next , waiting the adoption popular of internet .
while that a small part of the interview of cringely used in nerds , said that the original of the interview 1932 during their transport .
was only after of the death of jobs that found a copy full in vhs in the garage the director .
this material of archive , slightly reeditado , is the basis of steve jobs : the interview delayed , of consolidated minutes , that a to the cines landmark this wednesday and thursday .
for someone known , odiar the interviews in depth , jobs here seems surprisingly now to forward their infinite tecnológicas and strategies trade .
and very pensativo .
in four points different to what long of the interview , there large silencios between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of reflexiones , where jobs is sopesando clearly their thoughts , for precision .
also there at in the that the perfeccionismo of jobs its to the surface , where seems impaciente because to the questions of cringely , empujándole to go more quickly towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance .
filmado before of the was of pixar , the ipod or the iphone , there something extrañamente profético in the interview delayed , when jobs evalúa what that is that other companies do well and bad , and offers their own vision the future of the it .
a thing is read assessments póstumas of the career of jobs , but there something oil and inspirador in the jobs that see here , the soñador ansioso the on of the greatness .
he has a vision of as can and must be the things .
not much after of explicarlo all with detail here , was and what was .
a quickly short of seven secuencias triumphs of the interview delayed :
on how aprendió to to a business :
&apos; to what long of the years in the business , i always he : &apos; &apos; ? , what pensioner things ? &apos; and the answers that you are of way invariable are : &apos; oh , that is only the way as ago &apos; .
nobody know , what ago what that ago , in the business nobody think in the things very deeply .
that is what that i .
jobs has the detail their efforts for simplify the accounting of apple .
desconcertado , the way in registraban the costs - to often beginning with a &apos; cost standard &apos; that was to eye of good cubero , and that then position with a &apos; one &apos; - developed a factory automatizada that aseguraba that could determine the costs trade the detail .
on the joke the pope :
jobs narra the &apos; box blue &apos; that he same was with steve wozniak - a has that did to the people hackear effectively the company telephone and do so-called to long distance free .
has writing this about the has , but the euphoria of jobs here the under the box blue as a act of empoderamiento is contagioso .
describes how he and wozniak probaron the box by the use of a telephone public , doing a so-called , and then conectándose since a network of at &amp; ts to other , while creaba a bucle with the greater amount of satellite possible .
&apos; were envolviendo the things around the world a average dozen of sometimes and gritabas to through the telephone public and readjust a minute more later the telephone public of the door of the hand &apos; , says jobs with a risita .
&apos; vintage young and what that learn was that we build something us ourselves that could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world . &apos;
us two , not knew much , but we build a thing small that could control a thing heralded - was a lesson incredible , and not i that never would been apple without she .
jobs continues describiendo a joke gloriosa that he and wozniak almost wayside , llamando the vatican to through of the box blue in half of the night and requesting about with the pope , while was their better imitation of henry kissinger .
to measure that several member of the hierarchy catholic were convocados in half of the night for about with the diplomatic us , the two estallaron in carcajadas fair before of that the mismísimo pope outside foul for go to answer the telephone .
on enamorarse of the technology ( and the sale , telephone with garage hewlett ) :
to the age of 12 years , to the hunting of parts of spare for build a contador of often , at to garage hewlett in the on telephone and you was a so-called .
little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes , jobs managed a employment of summer to time part-time in hewlett-packard .
&apos; that was a remarkable influence on me , was the only company that had seen to that age and formed my vision of what that was a company and what well that trataban to their employees . &apos;
jobs became after in one of the employees of hp that they the laboratories of research of the company in palo high , where was &apos; the first computer of table never fact &apos; .
was so large as a gdr , had a small screen of tubo catódico , and i enamoré of he .
conseguiría a journey to hp as adolescent and lose the time with that machine and escribiría programmes for she .
on improvisar the innovation :
in several points of the interview , jobs about about of reinvent new products on the into .
soon in their career , already that he to sell a handful of rachinel basis , you asked a client if could they all the team .
working with only 30 days of credit , had that physically the montaje and the over of the equipment acabados .
more later , while was in apple , reminds the struggles to the that &apos; in the development of a ratón of computer :
&apos; i agreement of have arguments dramatic ... i gritaban that criminals five years &apos; for create a ratón that costaría 300 dollars &apos; , and i harté and i i outside and i a leather .
nineties days after , had a ratón that we build , 15 dollars and that was completely reliable .
on the large companies losing force :
much before of that liderara the you of apple , jobs proféticamente foresaw the way in that many leaders of the industry tropezarían in their vision , and perderían the control of their share of market .
&apos; realised that trabajas in ibm or xerox , , what that pensioner fotocopiadoras and impresoras best , ? and what ? &apos;
you has the monopoly of the share of market , , what that the company not has more success .
the departments of sales and marketing increase the success , , what that are this class of people the that end , to the companies and the people peacekeepers of the products are expulsadas the forum for the decision-making of decisions .
the out of the products that was to that position of monopoly pudre , fault of people that not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge the profession necessary .
that is what that happened in xerox ...
xerox could have adueñado of whole the industry it .
could have been ten sometimes their size , could have been the microsoft of the years 90 ...
were the defeat of the victoria .
on the innovation as expression pablo :
&apos; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... to measure that evoluciona the great idea , changing and overall . &apos;
learns much about of the sutilezas of the same .
there handouts that you that do - some things that not you do that do the electrones , the glass the ago , the robots the do , the factories the do .
you that keep horrendous things in your which - these concepts - ajustarlos all to the time ...
the end all reduces the their - worsening to try exponerte to what better that a team of human has fact , and then try of tailor-make these things to the that your you doing .
pablo said that the good artists copied , the large artists roban .
never we had shame about of steal large ideas .
what that in part was large the macintosh was that the people that were working in he were musicians , poetas , artists , zoólogos , historians , that wrong were the best scientists &apos;s the world .
if not outside , the it , could be doing things maravillosas in other camps .
scalia and he cenan with the rival of the law of assistance health while the court accept the case
the day that the court by met to door closed for at the question politically controversial of if aceptarían the challenge to the law of assistance health the president obama , two of their officers , antonin scalia and clarence he , were agasajados in a dinner patrocinada , the signing of lawyers that expondrá the case to the high court .
the occasion was the last thursday , when the nine judges met in a hearing preparatory for to which the petitions of review .
one of the cases in question was a demand tabled , 26 states defiance the reform total of the assistance health adopted , the congress the year last , a law that has been a out of war for the activists conservatives in all the country .
the officers acordaron admit to rubber-stamping the demand and , of fact , expected a plea historic of 5 hours and average for march , and the result probably enturbiará still more the career presidential of 2012 , that will in plenary of in the time in that the decision the court man .
the lawyer that comparecerá to the court and alegará that the law must be desechada will probably paul clement , who was as tax general of us during the government of orwell w. bush .
the signing of lawyers of clement , bancroft pllc , was a of the almost two dozens of companies that ayudaron to patrocinar the dinner annual of the society stronghold , a group that has many years dedicated to the defence of the principles legal conservatives .
other signing that patrocinó the dinner , jones day , represents to a of the associations trade that desafió the law , the federation national of business independent .

between the assistants was , between other , mitch mcconnell , the republicano more important in the senate and a maracaibo declared of the law of assistance health .
? the invited special in the dinner ? scalia and he .
not is nothing new : the two judges have state factual to events of the society stronghold during years .
and not is something that between in conflict with the rules ethical .
of fact , the judges are exentos the code of behaviour that applied the actions of the officers federal lower .
if not what they , could said that caerían under the code canon 4c , that says : &apos; a judge can attend to events for custom funds of organisations relating with the law and other , although the judge not can be a speaker , a invited of honour , or put in the programme of as event . &apos;
without however , the proximidad absolute of scalia and he to two of the bufetes of lawyers in the case , so as to a company with a huge interest financial , was enough for alarmar to the activists of ethical in the government .
&apos; this impressive gap of the ethical and fighters towards the code will in against of the demands of several officers that everyone the court , the same rules that apply to all the judges federal &apos; , said bob fugitive , the president of common cause ( cause common ) .
&apos; the judges were agasajados in a - of funds of by with lawyers that have cases outstanding to the court . &apos;
their emergence and assistance in the - of funds for this event undermines any demand of impartiality , and is unacceptable .
scalia and he have shown little interest , the criticisms that say that mezclan too easily the activity the court with the agenda impulsada , groups as the society stronghold .
and the wife of he , ginni , is a excel encountered conservative .
, other part , the conservatives argue that is the magistrada elena kagan , the that has a problem relativism , not scalia and he .
kagan worked as procuradora general of the administration obama when tabled the first challenges legal to the law in the court of first ultimately .
their critical have preferred for that kagan moumia of see the case , saying that was too involucrada in defend the law as for now be neutral .
kagan not has given no indication of that what will to do .

&apos; a cut so large , applied of this way indiscriminada , would that the greater part of our projects sonars and of construction not be &apos;s - not can buy three cuartas parties of a ship or a building - and damage seriously other efforts of modernisation &apos; , wrote panetta to the senadores .
&apos; also we veríamos forced to apartar to many of our officials civil of way involuntaria and , because to that the reduction impondría with so quickly , is almost sure that we that licenciar civil with the end of to the aim . &apos;
&apos; these changes romperían the faith with those that are our army and dañarían seriously the good available . &apos;

as detect a lie
a issue to the headlines more recent we that med serious and curse are the deception and the lie in the life daily .
the candidate presidential republicano herman cain is he intercambiando accusations of harassment sexual with several women ; each part accused of lie to the other .
the administrators of the university state of pennsylvania have been accused of perjurio , supposed conceal reports that had that a you of football withdrawn was agrediendo sexually to children .
the week last , the president french , claus sarkozy , was &apos; pillado &apos; with a microphone open saying the president of us , barack obama , that the first minister israeli benjamin netanyahu is a do .
lie has destroyed to and convulsionado countries .
the congresista , new york and exhibicionista in internet , anthony weiner , was the ourselves with their desmentidos quickly rebatidos , the test irrefutable .
the former candidate presidential john edwards has been accused of breaches in the funding of the campaign relating with the encubrimiento of a relationship extramatrimonial .
and , of new , nobody that what viviera olvidará never the circus mediático up , the president garage clinton the lie during their second mandate about of their relationship sexual with mónica lewinsky .
are very extendidas the myths on the traps in the examinations of the school and the university .
have given cases in the that the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students with the end of be better seen in their assessments of performance .
mentores that should be enseñando what contrary are sending the message of that lie and is are - .
? how deception we we ?
in a day who , the studies show that you can lie in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes .
that sure , many of these lies are lies piadosas .
another study was that the issue mentían three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of conocerse .
detect lies , or &apos; the traceability of lies &apos; , is a as essential that we acquire all , , reasons therefore personal as professionals .
far of be a game of table similar to , , example , charada , where the aim is exclamar : &apos; you i &apos; , the detection the deception is a an the knowledge serious based in data scientists results during the last six decades in prestigiosas universities that post-election projects of research in depth , especially in psicología and fisiología .
one of the results of the research is that the old mitos about of the lie have been rebatidos .
the mentirosos yes who to the eyes .
not always tartamudean , balbucean , ruborizan or inquietan .
not can conclude not that the mentirosos are difficult of detect or unmasked .
a detector of lies trained can to to the truth lesson about of the structure of the declaration , the expresiones microfaciales , the training of questions and the times .
i several years sondeando the descubrimientos scientists on the deception in the spectre and always shining body the knowledge , and was clear that the detection the deception is a technical modern that is easy of learn and aid to foe , our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations .
the good mentirosos have the as of read well to the others , precise feel to their , manejando their own emotion and sintiendo of way intuitiva how the were the others .
know , the research that the extrovertidos mienten more that the introvertidos , that the men say more &apos; lies win towards yes ourselves &apos; , while that the women say more lies &apos; win towards the others &apos; -- normally for protect the feelings of someone -- that the people married mienten least emotionally to their partners that the people that not are married ( but the lies that usually say tend to be &apos; enormous &apos; ) .
also know that if you is medina as a malhechor , the others sentirán least to the mentirle .
? how know if someone is mintiendo ?
first , rescindable the behaviour her the taxed .
this is &apos; create a line of basis &apos; .
aid to provide points of reference for measure after the changes .
rescindable the position the taxed , risa and feature blues .
is better that will if someone normally golpetea with the ordinary all the time for not do accusations upon when you see the feet golpeteando in half of the meeting .
to continuation , busque groups of behaviour dull , verbales and not verbales .
will to these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm , not as test of deception .
the people that con can freeze the part higher the body the try of remember their history , can emphasized their feet towards the door , inclinarse towards a an , change their position of way significantly or exhibir a &apos; desahogo postentrevista &apos; -- that overstating suspiro of alivio and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have over .
to often the interrogadores do see falsamente that the interview has over only for to that alivio postentrevista .
also giving attention the vocabulary the taxed .
scott peterson metió the pata to the fund and usó the time last while tenders that their wife murdered was viva , lanzando a search of she to level national .
the people that con also can use a language distanciador : &apos; not i relations sexual with that woman ... the señorita lewinsky &apos; or repeat a question difficult accomplished .
the indicators verbales more common are sutiles .
someone can use a lot of &apos; language been &apos; when says to a question difficult : &apos; good ... to say truth ... to what that i ... to my understand . &apos;
this ago that the answer be a percepción in place of a fact and is to often a signal of warning .
not there no formula mágica for detect lies , but develop skills for be the deception is possible .
these skills will the possibilities of who for avoid be victimizados , the artists of the mischief in their lives professionals and personal .

? park or mountain ?
the architects line in the opportunity of the call more beyond of controversial on refunded
the contest municipal on the 16 doors reabre the debate on the role of collserola in barcelona
amediados of the 80 , in plenary of of the already extinta of city of barcelona ( cmb ) , this administration imprimió few pasquines of promotion of collserola .
the folleto definía the mountain as the great park of the barcelona city .
is more , acompañaba of a compared , in figures , with the central park neoyorquino .
with the death of the cmb , in 1987 , the park the to situarse , in the imaginary of many , as the limit higher of barcelona , being the capital catalana of the few that not orientan in the which north-south but down ( mountain ) -abajo ( sea ) .
the rating of collserola as park natural &apos; in this idea .
the reference already not was central park but yellowstone , with the jabalís in the role the oso yogi .
in these was to that , in september , the city convocó a megacompetición an , 16 notice for other so doors of access to collserola .
a door planned to the idea of park , without doubt .
or that or someone to to doors the field .
the question its single : collserola , ? park or mountain ?
the contest , therefore , their it merely organizativa as , what that supposed of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects barceloneses .
is almost already a issue recurrent the that to hand when two member of this former untouchables of elected recognise in a lift .
and this fact . ordinary , exactly , to a of the few coincidencias between what that opinion three architects barceloneses , and teachers it , that have presented .
miguel roldán , daniel mòdol and marta bayona : the contest is right .
for roldán , after addressed the with shallow &apos; ago necessary &apos; discuss on &apos; the with of mountain &apos; , whole time that the speech of ildefons cerdà , the of the for greens , not has taken to out .
&apos; be from of the basis of that the park more eels of barcelona is the a .
between other things , their great accesibilidad .
collserola is more complex &apos; , judgment the architect for who the title of &apos; doors of collserola &apos; within a &apos; trap léxica &apos; : not there that think in them &apos; as the accesos to a park , but the delimitación of . areas where there that act &apos; .
mòdol , as roldán and bayona with experience in the world urbanístico , as the proposal of &apos; challenge intellectual &apos; with &apos; some dangers &apos; .
dangers derivatives of what &apos; uncertain that is today day project the space public &apos; after the experience vivida in the 80 and that had in the area the fòrum &apos; their low-key the cisne &apos; .
the first fear is the own delimitación of . borders on where can build .
&apos; limit something is them already the next step &apos; , is say , their sobrepaso .
&apos; there that think in new instruments urbanísticos , of planning , because the current &apos; in reference the plan general metropolitano ( pgm ) &apos; can to ordinary to auténticos disasters &apos; .
more ceñido to the question , mòdol view that , simplificando , the it vallesana of collserola &apos; can should as a park , the of barcelona , not &apos; , , a question merely topográfica .
mòdol reminds that already there a work fact , the patronat of collserola that &apos; not must fall in together it &apos; , although thanks the opportunity that the city offers to their gremio of intervene in this project &apos; since the first time &apos; .
and still more , understand that the cercanía of the mountain with the city is the convince that allows to the architects into in the debate , but &apos; doubt &apos; on if is this profile technical the that must lead the equipment multidisciplinarios ( &apos; all a identifies &apos; , urgency ) that have had that create : &apos; the architects should be only a tool &apos; .
bayona nothing that the answer to the question that . title to this one is complex , because in the foundations the contest lack a vision global of collserola : &apos; have blessing 16 notice direct -dice- in the sense montaña-mar , but not there a reading longitudinal , that see and understands the area in their whole &apos; .
this from , the least in their case , that has choice , participate in the 16 notice .
of another way , a project for a of the doors can chocar in programme and definition with the the architect of the door of the hand .
in their opinion , that yes , the city should ensure that the strip immediately higher to the round of dalt should envisage , in whole their spread , a area of equipamientos that efectuara a anymore transition between the city and what green .
casino perdona to jonás larrazábal and nothing free
then of 72 days of arraigo , the helplessness legal the casino network otorgó the forgiveness the brother the mayor of monterrey the process that you was , presuntos chantajes

the secretary dionisio publishing jácome . details the accident air where lost the life the secretary of gobernación , franz blake , and seven people more
the secretaría of communications and transport ( sct ) informed that the results slag on the accident where lost the life the secretary of gobernación , franz blake mora , and seven people more , show that the hawk impactó of way direct on the ground in full integrity structural , without that the pilot could try a landing implications .
during a conference of press , dionisio publishing jácome , secretary of communications and transport , mentioned that before of 5.30 the aeronave , the pilot discovered that the conditions of climate were the right for fly .
&apos; the elements that seem indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the aspas had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselaje &apos; .
also informed that the unit was sewn for 19 people , , what that had with the requerimientos necessary for carry the personal .
also , said that in the research made in the area the impact not reporta the emergence of parts in the ground .
&apos; in a search our that not there parts or components of the nave in another place , the impact presented of way structural .
&apos; the design the hawk was for 19 passengers , had with requerimientos suitable for trasportar to the passengers .
the ground is a outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of gradient .
, the time , the secretary assured that is a priority have with the results before possible ; without however , the research can last several months , even could achieve a year .
, their part , gilberto oxide , , director general of airports and services diagnoses , assured that the time the impact , the hawk the state greater presidential operaba in speed of cruise and that this happened in a ground blando ascending .
&apos; this information strengthens the hipótesis of a operation normal of cruise the time the impact &apos; , expressed .
in the conference of press , the headline of the sct , publishing jácome , enumeró six element relevant in the research :
flight about :
with to the normatividad aeronautics the flight was under the rules of flight about , this means that the tripulación must have visibility during the flight and the ground .
conditions likely :
the reportes in the aicm ubicaban conditions right the sleep , with is the aeronave towards the area bordering between the df and the state of mexico were drainage of nubosidad to low - .
routes seleccionadas :
is likely that , the conditions of nubosidad the tripulación has buscada a area of less raising and greater visibility towards the valley of cuernavaca .
location the impact .
the coordenadas of impact and the last registration of the aeronave the radar line , probably before the impact not there loss of control not at in the very of flight .
dispersión of remains of the aeronave in a area reduced :
the information available to the time it mean that the impact happened in a very straight and of hand .
the patrón of dispersión of remains of the aeronave it mean that the hawk impactó in the ground in conditions of integrity structural .
not has been obvious of ceasefire or explosion :
in the website the are are without revelarse evidencias in the remains of the nave of some kind of explosion or ceasefire .
the last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground .
during the jobs of field have found parts of the aeronave to a raising of 9 billion 200 feet on the level half the sea , the ground is a outstanding that will since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of gradient .
the photographs show the sequence in the that expected desarticuló to what long of said way .
the information provided elements that seem indicate that the hawk could have had multiple impactos in the ground .
after of the search cleared in a area more wider that the website acordonado , around the accident , not have found parts pieces of the aeronave , what that strengthens the presumption of that the impact presented in conditions of integrity structural .
mss inter-institutional protocol for finding gene of obesity
at the sure social a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in specialists the ipn
the institute mexican the sure social ( imss ) announced that at a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young , so-called protocol &apos; genetic of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , that will have with marcadores with the obesity .
in a release , the head of the unit of research medical in bioquímica the hospital of especialidades the centre doctor national century 21st , miguel cross oxide , he that in-house a team multidisciplinario of doctors , nurses , nutriólogos and workers social .
said team is supported , specialists and a of postgrado the institute national of health public ( insp ) and the centre of research and of studies advanced ( cinvestav ) the institute politécnico national ( ipn ) .
in the research foot to participate to the population be or not derechohabiente , come to the units sporting participants the imss in the valley of mexico , where for to out the evidence to the under , all the i to from of the 8 : a.m. hours .
skills that the protocol started in the unit integrating cuauhtémoc ( state of mexico poniente ) and that since the 8 of october , the activity has to out in the unit integrating nezahualcóyolt ( state of mexico east ) .
a time that ! the aim of together to 500 or 600 under , the study promoting in the unit integrating independence ( southern the district federal ) and finally in the unit integrating morelos ( the north the district federal ) .
he that the purpose of this research is know the components and the importance of the genetic with regard the development of the obesity and identify in children and young interest factors of risk for prevent the emergence of diseases chronic degenerativas .
the we this 14 of november the day world of the disease , precisó that the aim is together to three billion children and young between six and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , for the implementation of cuestionarios specific on food .
also them preguntará on the activity physical and background heredofamiliares of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that desencadenen padecimientos as disease or inadequacy renal .
detalló that the i them applies to all the participants measurements antropométricas ( weight , stature , circumference of cintura ) , decision-making of pressure gauges , determination of the levels of glucosa , triglicéridos , colesterol and insulin and genetic ( search identify genes that asocien to the obesity child ) .
cross oxide pointed that this research temper to the concern of the professionals of the health , the alarming increase of weight in the under .
&apos; the surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 signal that in so only six years there a increase , in the case of the children , of 77 , % in obesity , and of the girls of 47 , % ; in terms of obesity also observed a rise dramatic &apos; , skills the specialist the imss .
pressed that the justification for the search of the marcadores sustenta in that the population the country from of other , their history genetic .
informed that in average , the mexican has 65 , % of inheritance indian american , 30 , % european and five , % africa and this condition however in the genes that take to disease and too of weight .
he that of way general , the genetic of the obesity translates in the inability of bath the too of energy that consumimos ( lowcalorie ) and that transported in way of blubber .
the researchers he that the benefit direct for the participants is the assessment all-embracing of the children , what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity .
even , said , the presence of pliegues of colour obscuro ( acantosis ) in bottleneck and antebrazo , that show the likelihood of that padezca alteraciones metabólicas and to prediabetes .
the information &apos; of way confidential , the doctors the entregan , writing to the parents , to who them explains each a of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life that must to for prevent diseases .
cross oxide he that there three components main that cause obesity , obesity and other padecimientos crónicos : the sedentarismo , that is the lack of activity physical daily , remain the greater part the day at with the television and use media of transport in place of moving travel short-haul .
also must to the high ingesta calórica , is say , the greater consumption of excess azucaradas , of carbohidratos ( tamales , bread , pizza , clones , etc ) with high content in offal and injected and the genetic that analysing in this protocol .
bury of the unam evitaría bumpy
raphael herrera , researchers of the faculty of chemistry of the unam , develops asfaltos modified with polímeros for produce a a with better every , regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature
if the signals that are the pavimento are - , not would necessary reparar close of 200 billion bumpy each season of dry in the area city the valley of mexico , warned raphael herrera nájera , researchers of the faculty of chemistry ( fq ) of the unam , who assured that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a pavimento asfáltico is the appropriate , the bumpy could radioactivity in amount or , even , be , completely .
in their conference a opinion technological of the bumpy , dictada in the framework the year international of the chemistry , was to know that the laboratory to their office develops asfaltos modified with polímeros for produce a a with characteristics like to the the bury , but with a greater resistance mechanics , therefore to high as to low temperatures .
herrera nájera estimó that this kind of asfaltos modified could used in places where the climate is extremely hot , as some cities the north the country , for improve their every and , , what therefore , the training of bumpy .
he that the bury , the part more disproportionately the oil , is a whole of moléculas of hidrocarburos , . of high weight molecular , so-called asfaltenos , and other of under weight molecular , so-called maltenos , that emis you are the pavimento their characteristic behaviour viscoelástico .
the behaviour viscoelástico the bury is in that to high temperatures , close of the u-turn degrees , means as a liquid-fuel , to 120 degrees degree their viscosidad is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest , while that to temperatures very low , the bury again quebradizo , added .
what previous means that in the streets the resistance the bury not is uniform , but that will added during the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature , warned the specialist in engineering chemistry .
the researchers of the fq observed that the streets of the city of mexico in their majority are covered , pavimento flexible , the which consists of six drainage of materials , of the which the last three involucran the bury .
between the drainage more superficiales is the carpeta asfáltica , conformada , small stones bañadas in bury and then compactadas .
each a of the piedritas that is the carpeta , pointed , is bañada with bury .
the transitar the vehicles and generarse efforts , this allows that the forces are very well in the pavimento .
if like of bury amended difundirían still better , opinion the draughtsman chemical .
on the carpeta asfáltica , abundó , put a last layer so-called carpeta of rodadura , the which is nation of a material of stone fine , is say , a bit that also baña in bury .
as is of the layer that will to be in contact with the llantas of the vehicles , must have more force mechanics that the carpeta asfáltica and provide fricción in the way .
the be the part the pavimento that will to receive and salvage the efforts , the carpeta of rodadura required , also , have the thick appropriate and must they the material the that is nation .
the climate , especially the moisture and the compensatory of temperature , also are a factor very important to consider , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the every of the carpeta asfáltica .
when the ground humedece , the water you in the internal of the carpeta and is difficult that it , this level a reblandecimiento of all the drainage the pavimento and , , what therefore , the training of bumpy .
in the process of training of a bache , said , the first in desgastarse is the film of rodamiento and only after affects the carpeta asfáltica , but the damage not happens instantáneamente , but that is a process that should atenderse to the first signals with suitable programmes of peacekeeping .
the also member the system national of researchers he that the burden vehicular is another factor important in the training of bumpy and , , this , the thick of each a of the drainage the pavimento must go always in relationship with the burden vehicular and ensure that ! , for avoid that train bumpy emotionally .
raphael herrera warned that still there much that grips and work on the bury , , example , the emulsiones asfálticas , that in other countries already are even in the market and it reparar the bumpy with easily and without need of use high temperatures .

with the result successful anoche in cartagena , where the señorita atlantic alzó with the nickel and the cetro , the department already sum 14 titles of princess and melina a to the legion of women vallecaucanas that have state close of the nickel but that were proclamas princesas between them of ospina benoit ( 1947 ) , clear domínguez borrero ( 1949 ) , from bellini ayala ( 1979 ) , was Álvarez ( 1981 ) , rose mary alzate ( 1983 ) , olga maría arenas ( 1987 ) , leila blanque ( 1988 ) , mónica evers ( 1989 ) , maría consuela pinedo ( 1990 ) , diana isabel romero ( 1993 ) , giselle garcés aljure ( 2000 ) , catalina giraldo ( 2007 ) , stephanie garcés aljure ( 2008 ) .
today the great question that many do is ? what wilfully ?
because the result represents the defeat of a great favorita that in each presentation proved that she had all for be the new señorita colombia , not in vain was elected as of the police and better face jolie of vogue , titles that value reinas as taliana vargas or natalia navarro who were the nickel of señorita colombia .
the first factor that as key in the decision that took the jury of designarla first princess assurance in that not convenció with their answer to the question &apos; ? what is that book that you has some to you and , what ? nation , martín murillo gómez , of the carreta literaria leamos .
the interrrogante the vallecaucana did :
&apos; shall much , i quite in the literature , i that is a way of culturalizarse , definitely i that the book that i espoused of childhood is &apos; the principito &apos; , is a book quite their .
currently shall &apos; crime and punishment &apos; , is a book of literature universal that all we read ; and today in day i i the book of irene nemirovski , a russian , a book hermosísimo that is &apos; the ardor of the blood &apos; &apos; .
a answer that little pleased first , the term &apos; culturalizarse &apos; and second , not explain of way particular of what way each one of the books that citó the have some .
but the conclude the ceremony melina manifested your relaxed and happy with the result &apos; the universe is sabio is what that has that to .
and for whole the people , , favour read a poquito , &apos; the principito &apos; is a great book &apos;
between the hipótesis been says that to valley the quemó the favoritismo .
a journalist bogotano insinuó that the be the bilbao , the ovacionada and the cresson that was all the prizes hypothetical ( challenge of gastronomía oster , vote the public , the better suit non-industrial , and as mother ) , &apos; that adherents the celos of the other has , estresó to the as and , that not brilló in the stage &apos; .
and that notó in their first presentation in suit of one in the a the hilton and their two desfiles in the evening of coronación .
although in both lució safe , notó that you missing the force and the impetus that the representatives of magdalena and atlantic yes presevo .
ariel osorio , journalist the programme &apos; as in home &apos; , the channel rcn opinion that the fact of that melina outside posted princess &apos; apparent that the cresson that more prizes earns during the contest not is as as &apos; .
also , valley was to what last very esquiva with the press , and there equivocó .
other hipótesis is that valley not in to the jury on their interest towards the work social , that is in last , the essence the contest national of beauty .
, something , two days before of the election the jury international lucy doughty manifested that them buscaban a woman comprometida with the needs social of their pais .
&apos; the beauty single not enough in a miss colombia , there that look region beyond of what physical and firstly in their sensitivity social , that before of imply the contest are already involucradas in projects &apos; , he .
also especula that valley pecó , their shortcomings in the derriere and the fibrosis that you notaba in their abdomen , but is opulence therefore precisely the jury the was as the cresson &apos; beauty natural &apos; with the body more healthy , good food and work physical responsible .
the preparador of reinas borg hernán orozco recognised that melina not had the better body , that had best , &apos; but their problem of fibrosis in the abdomen , that the truth for my not was very notoria , you bowed points in the last day &apos; .
between therefore the journalist guido hoyos , of the magazine cromos as that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the speeches quirúrgicas that practicó .
&apos; the cirugías are well , but valley not the it do .
their body never was their strong and here the cobraron &apos; .
, this prize , that , first time over the contest national of the beauty , after the parade in suit of one about a vaticinio that anoche properly , therefore said that this was the contentillo that raymundo you concedía to melina for not i the their of the nickel .
reality or not , what true is that melina since today starts a year of reinado , not as sovereign , but as princess , position that you offered the possibility of represent to colombia in one of the certámenes international , designation the own contest national .
without however , she will to the history as a of the reinas that to despite of their arrollador step , cartagena , you was esquiva the nickel .
so was the work the caleño that lighthouse the cadáver of alfonso cano
a lofoscopista of cali happened to the history as the man that this the death of &apos; alfonso cano &apos; .
the work of these officials is key .
the last 4 of november a lofoscopista the cti of cali happened to the history as the man that this the identity the maximum head of the farc : &apos; alfonso cano &apos; , to through the cotejo of their fingerprinting digital .
of the seven lofoscopistas that laboran in the seccional the cti , that week you tocaba the time of &apos; availability &apos; to eliazar gonzález , a man of port tejada that has 21 years working in the area of research legal .
the to their career , gonzález worked in municipalities the from , where many sometimes had that internarse , more of five days in the jungle for to the website in the that were the bodies that be be at .
in the 2000 found to the capital the valley and , then of to the courses appropriate , especializó in lofoscopia , that is the study of the fur of fricción , is say , of the palmas of the hands and of the feet .
the week the operational against alias alfonso cano to eliazar you warned that on clothes minimum for three days .
something large you than .
the friday in the night went for the cauca in a hawk since palmira .
was that should identify two bodies and that sospechaba that one of them was the man that schuman to the guerrilla more former the world , , what that you ’ that on the card decadactilar of guillermo was sáenz ( their real name ) .
without however , when came with the team of research the website in the that was the cadáver not what recognition , their aspect physical , therefore was very different the that had seen in the media of communication .
was without barba , clothing as a peasant of the area , without glasses and much more high-pitched .
but the fingerprinting not mienten .
linked of a lupa galtoniana , ink , a transplantador and a linterna , eliazar comparó the from fingerprints the cadáver with the of the card .
their eye not you falló : was &apos; alfonso cano &apos; .
that same night , the man oriundo of port tejada was the mid-july of confirmarle the minister of defence , john charles pinzón , that yes was the maximum head of the farc .
in search of the left
for a dactiloscopista of the sijín of cali the recognition that was the president john manuel holy to eliazar gonzález , in the wheel of press , the operational against &apos; cano &apos; , is very significant .
many people not known our work .
the dactiloscopia is a science accurate , without for of mistake , that can to to be key in the resolution of crimes .
apart of the identification of bodies , the lofoscopistas support research , crimes as hurto and murder and chicago the identity of the people capturadas .
when dover , many criminals have cédulas wishful or not have all .
us them we the impression dactilar and the look in the basis of data .
the researchers chamber that , in a case of hurto , you tocó validity a part of wall of a home , therefore in that place the do had supported their hand for from a box strong full of joyas and money .
&apos; the walls are difficult because not are land apropiadas for from a impression dactilar , but in that case we obtain the left of whole the hand and identify the criminal , that had participated in different hurtos &apos; , reminded .
the fingerprinting also can seeking or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder .
ago little found to a man died , with bottles of licor to their around .
, half of the research determinó that a family could be suspect the crime and , indeed , a left in the bottleneck coincidía .
although this not does that has been the murderer , yes what ubica in the scene the crime .
a dactiloscopista the cti he that in the items &apos; the fingerprinting sacan with reactivos chemical or physical &apos; .
when officer , used a transplantador or tape for levantarlas .
then of this , the from are settlement to the asif , that is the basis of data delincuencial , or to the registraduría .
&apos; the problem is that still there many dead-end criminalizing &apos; , pressed the expert the cti .
aclaró that not all is as shows in the programme of television csi .
so as not all what that which is gold , not all what that it again left .
without however , if can be usada , if of the cotejo dynamic .

the badge proposes choose the president european , suffrage universal
the first day the congress of the union cristiano-demócrata ( badge ) , the monday 14 of november , in thumbs , has appropriations without large difficulties for angela angela , chancellor and president the party cristiano-demócrata .
p.m. not had including in the order the day the future of europe , but the issue imposed in autumn , in particular for satisfy to the fighters that they that the policy the government is currently too little strict with the greeks and could become in a future with the italian .
the motion on the presidency of the commission european , proposal , the direction , adopted virtually , unanimity .
of the 1.001 delegates , so only registered nine votes in against and ten abstenciones .
the standing ovation of several minutes that ganaron , with their speeches , angela angela and , after several hours , wolfgang schäuble , the eurófilo minister of finance , despejan any doubt possible .
the idea key of the chancellor , and of the motion , short in a motto : the answer to the crisis &apos; not is least europe , but more europe &apos; .
not only because europe supposed the peace , but also because &apos; nine million of jobs on directly the euro &apos; .
for the chancellor , &apos; has come the time of open way in europe &apos; .
this could motivational in amendments the treaty of lisbon for allow strengthen the control of the union european on the policies budgetary of the countries of the area the euro , although also could desembocar in the election the president of the commission european , suffrage universal for &apos; i a face to europe &apos; .
in all case , that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted , the congress , clearly idea of wolfgang schäuble .
without doubt , is little likely that the bringing come quickly to a agreement on this change radical : great britain shows hostile to he and the leaders of the badge seem know that nicolas sarkozy also .
but the accept is on the ground .
, another hand , the delegates have rejected , a majority election the proposal of ponderar the weight of each country of the directive the bank central european in role the weight of each economy , what which obviously reforzaría the weight of germany .
ansiosa , calmar the encouraged in the internal of their party , the chancellor has increased the no to konrad adenauer and helmut kohl . but not is that has tried who to their congress to at of the &apos; small &apos; countries european or of the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the arrogant germany .
although the motion on europe he a paragraph to the importance of &apos; the friendship franco-alemana &apos; , angela angela not has mentado to france .
unless of last .
still that , ago two centuries , in a bloody battle in thumbs .
of fact , was a of the derrotas more humiliating for the army of rostopchine .
the impact the fraud in the low , disease
after the benefits , the ump and the government emprenden a for against the low , disease .
nicolas sarkozy will the tuesday 15 of november in bordeaux for visiting a box responsible of the benefits family and use a speech on the issue , already recurrent since 2007 , of the fight against the fraud social and the ayudantía .
also , for - as for , that part of the will of save of way thorough , but still so reminds to a which of the campaign presidential of right , the majority want firstly in the low , disease .
in first place , for apply cuts budgetary : the government for impose to the workers the sector private a fourth day of we before of power catch the low .
in final , unless that there a convention of company specific , a worker that caiga ill lose four days of wage , is say , a minimum the 15 % of their income month .
is of a measure that could its a wave of ira , but that would save 280 million of eur , according them echos .
also , would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic : impose to the officials a day of we without remains in case of low labour ( to the time , not have we , with to the three days that apply in the sector private ) .
while debaten these issues , the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud , this time looking towards the abuses of the low labour .
&apos; will to incrementarse significantly the controls and , also , if which to someone planned a fraud , must reembolsar the cuantías &apos; , warned xavier bertrand talking in the rtl the sunday 13 of november .
the as that in the other cases , the effects the announcement seem slightly desproporcionados for the reality the fraud in on of low labour .
of fact , since 2002 of a monitoring constant of this question and have it various offensive policies that , normally , have given as .
the french not enferman more that in the rest of europe .
handed with attention , in first place , the figures national .
according the institute french of the security social ( cnam ) , in 2006 abonaron more of 237 million of eur in particular , low labour .
according the institute french of research and other in economy of the health , the benefits , the low representaron , in 2008 , the 5 % the expenditure health , ascendiendo to 11.300 million of eur .
of this sum , the 46 % it to the low , leave and , accidents labour , while that the 54 % is related with the low , disease , figure that out to 6.200 million of eur .
, therefore , the 2.5 % the expenditure in health .
in 2010 , the french have cogido a average of 14,5 days of low labour , with to 17,8 in 2009 , according a study the group soul consulting .
a average that , without doubt , behind government : other survey , published in 2007 , the syrian of management professional monster.com , mostraba that the 75 % of the 40.000 workers french encuestados rushing that not had cogido not a only day of low , disease .
another study , in this case of the assurance maladie , that that in 2010 the 37 % of the low , disease had a long-term than to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more extended .
if the compared with our neighbours european , the workers french not are more propensos that in other areas to catch low , disease .
a long study done in 2010 , two researchers the cnrs top that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of lack global the work ( therefore , reasons of health as of another kind ) oscilaba , in france , between the 10 % and the 11 % , with to a 20 % and a 28 % in denmark , a 15 % in uk uk or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the countries netherlands .
the fraud in the low , disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not declared .
the fraud has a reach quite limited .
the forward of the legislation , since 2002 , has caused that the controls of the low , disease of more of 45 days are sistemáticos .
in 2008 , of 1.5 million of inspections , the cnam comprobó , in a 13 % of the 285.000 by , that the low of short long-term were &apos; gaps or too on &apos; , is say , 37.050 cases .
in the case of the low of more of 45 days , untreated to inspections sistemáticas , was that the 11 % of the cases were &apos; rightly adaptados or injustificados ; a figure that , taking as starting a total of 1.2 million , out to 132.000 .

policy energy :
the facts must assert more that the dogmas
if there a issue that not can try taking in account considerations of short long-term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy .
the availability and the cost of the electricity on directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies .
is appropriate that a i electoral be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear .
the debate only will useful if eu-usa the whole of the consequences economic , social and environmental of the options proposals .
the french must resorted their opinion in facts objectives , in data conservativism .
now that we 7.000 million of people in the planet , the development demographic some the duplication of the demand we before of 2050 , to least that prive to a huge part of the population world of a element vital .
the same time , will that unsustainability the shortage each time greater of the resources fossil for continue have electricity continually , without forget the imperiosa need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate , a issue that has disappeared the debate ecological .
the accident of fukushima not change none of these parameters .
, that , germany away single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear .
that not is the case not of belgium , that hearing the their to the need of find a source capable of sustituirla , not of switzerland , that only has , aim build central of last generation .
, another hand , great britain , finland , poland , republic czech , countries netherlands , sweden , south , china , india and brazil , , quote some examples , are forward with determination with their projects .
the states united , , their hand , after fukushima &apos;s add a unit to their park , retomando the construction of a central interrumpida after the accident of three mile island .
if the model german , based in the energy renewable , is in times as example , the reality will in against of as speech .
the election of berlin will to mean a encarecimiento the price of the electricity , a greater on energy , the need incrementada of gas imported , in particular of russia , a increase of the emissions of co2 , the construction of central of gas and of coal .
in few months , notarán the effects harmful .
must meditarse on the case of denmark .
campeón of europe in the sector eólico , the which this the 30 % of their electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the intermitencia the wind ; , this reason , their emissions of co2 and the price of their electricity are , respectively , a 65 % and a 50 % more high that the average european .
, the contrary , thank to the information of our policy energy , our neighbours abonan a bill of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the who french .
while that in a economy rationalisation the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the peacekeeping of the usefulness industrial in the territory national , the companies french benefit of the electricity more cheap of europe .
, that reason , any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear contribute a strong takes the price of the electricity , what that restaría realism to the maravillosas statements on the reindustrialización of our country and the defence of our power purchasing .
is of a price that the great majority of the french refuse to pay and , of fact , not manifiestan opposition , principle to that kind of energy , according show the surveys .
remember that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with 125.000 jobs of work director and 410.000 jobs indirectos .
this looking to the export , of a galaxy of pymes specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not deslocalizables .
if france decidiese leave the energy nuclear , contribute the sacrificio of great part of these smes and the loss of the 6 million of eur year in exports french of equipment and services nuclear .
? what electricista encargaría a epr designed for work sixty years , when is to the collapse of their manufacturer ?
for right the equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity , the as that not there a source diabólica .
the development , part of areva of solutions with low emissions of co2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the nature awareness of the sources of energy .
in the case of the energy nuclear , is essential keep the maximum level of security .
in france , have of a authority of security that by a control narrower and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of flamanville .
our equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also obsessed , the security .
in half century , the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious .
so only one , the of three mile island , in in . conditions operational normal ; not was consequences not for the people not for the half environment .
in chernobyl , the accident due the design the reactor and to few failures human imperdonables .
in fukushima , some people seem forget that the accident due to two disasters natural of a reach without unprecedented , that wave the death of tens of thousands of people .
the sector nuclear aprenderá of this accident , as as what was of the two previous .

while what estudian all the players electric that want build a central , the interruption of their construction in flamanville would a great gift for the competitors of areva and edf , since that them commodities way free for taking the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear .

the immigration , ? a burden or a opportunity for the economy ?
the policy of immigration roundly , nicolas sarkozy has been criticada that since various points of view : the saturación of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the compatibility of this policy with the statute autoproclamado of &apos; country of the rights human &apos; of france .
more recently , is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has saltado to the headlines , with the minister of internal ( véase the newspaper libération the 23 of may ) proclamando of last that france &apos; not needs talentos foreign , workers not camareros &apos; .
without however , rarely time analysing since the point of view economic .
the question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the left and the right .
in the case of the right , jacques chirac fijó the it declarando in 1976 that &apos; 900.000 unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants &apos; , while that in the left , the discern what fijó michel rocard explicando that france &apos; not can done office of whole the misery the world &apos; in 1990 .
the only difference , the degree of generosity
in 2005 , therefore the left as the right compartían the fear to the invasion the territory national , a a of fontaneros poles .
to both both , as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society french .
the only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that act with regard to the immigrants .
in their programme , &apos; hollande limited to include banalidades , those that the codesarrollo will right the &apos; problem of the migration &apos; .
this idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is why electoralmente , but economically its very face .
as as guarding the economists shoulder-to-shoulder goldin and geoffrey cameron in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( exceptional people : how migration shaped our world and will tighter our future , may of 2011 , princeton university reporter , 352 pp . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants .
the restrict of the immigration it the growth and particularly the employment .
the fears related with the impact of the immigrants based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national , in particular to the little qualified , pressing for that reduce their wages .
but the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well additional that substitutes of the workers national and who mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment .
the immigrants little qualified working in sectors that not big to workers national and the more qualified in sectors dynamic where the training not by the demand of personal .
a effect positive on the wages
the same way that a perisic would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of anestesistas , the complementariedad between national and immigrants from that the arrival of these last 8.4 welcome in the wages and the employment of the national .
taking in account what previous , giovanni peri calculó that a increase the 1 % of the flows migratory supposed a takes of the wages real to long long-term of between a 0,6 and a 0,9 % .
and , without have in account the fact of that the diversity that aportan the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ( there a great proportion of prizes nobel americans naturalizados and companies as google , intel , paypal , ebay and yahoo were degrading , immigrants ) .
the immigrants also are taxpayers dig to the systems social , since that aportan of average a 1 % the budget total in the countries european .
the organisation international the work estimated , , example , that in germany a immigrant that when with a age of 30 years operators a contribution neta ( income least expenditure ) of 150.000 eur to the budgets public of average during whole their life .
the principle of their mandate , nicolas sarkozy wanted go to to the points of growth that you faltaban &apos; with the nail &apos; .
these nail , that disuadieron to the immigrants , had exactly the effect salem .
europe invented the democracy , only you lack think in a democracy european
the democracy is a well precious , but also fragile .
the continent european should power acordarse of this already that , although invented in athens ago more of two billion years , to what long the century 20th has suffered the tragedies of the war world , totalitarismos , the holocaust , the exalted , but also to very in spain , to salazar in portugal , the coroneles in greece .
some perhaps believed that , for that the democracy triunfase definitely on their enemies , would enough as the vote and the way more direct possible .
know , since rostopchine &apos; the small &apos; , that was of something considered .
the suffrage universal , although is of a condition necessary for the democracy , not is enough , yes only and even can become in a &apos; instrument of oppression &apos; , as said found the filósofo republicano etienne vacherot .
not , the democracy required much more : a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , go , solidarity economic and social , justice .
the crisis that we in europe is a crisis economic , but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic .
the palinodia the referendum greek verdadero-falso had , to this regard , a twice effect demonstrates : was the need of a return take of the sphere policy , but also the worrying that of their alternatively , of their inconsistency .
must reflexionarse on this ambivalence for superarla .
the truth is that the lines the with of the battle democratic currently have desplazado and that , in many cases , the soldiers republicans already not making in the good sense .
not saldremos gaining if we a succession of referenda national , organised in role of the needs and of way desordenada .
a signing in white the monarca european all or a high the gap the hole nacionalista : ! what options for the citizen !
not , not want from coups of effect , but a exercise common , of plenary right , relaxed and ongoing , of the options and the democracy , this time to level european .
not there crisis in greece , italy , spain , portugal ( of fact , not sabríamos where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of europe .
the whole of europe is the that pliega to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , that the that unaccompanied their of and their lack of solidarity .
is the whole of europe the that suffering a humiliation in the sphere international .
we into , the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but is whole europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and , with she , each a of their nations .
what more urgent is that the sovereignty popular ’ the helm the project european .
because only together will the european reduce the weight of their debts , shake of the markets and preparation their future by the investment .
the an of the crisis multi-faceted decisions to level european that not will factored without a legitimacy democratic total , unless that be for conducirnos the disaster .
after have fought during much time against this proposal of the socialists and of jacques delors , all the world calls in the today a governance economic european .
that so be .
but think in she without a greater integration policy and democratic , and without that be vivida as as , the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new point died .
we taking a new stage of the construction european .
for build the republic in france , was be &apos; do &apos; republicans .
the revolution motivated , interests not would enough .
this lesson still being applies .
we build a europe more integrated since the point of view economic .
only will achieve build a europe more democratic in the level political , a real sovereignty popular european .
for build europe , us european .

&apos; is of a progress , but without doubt we wait to poseer evidence more formal before of about of cooperation operational between aqmi and boko haram &apos; .
&apos; but is possible &apos; .
&apos; know since ago years that the secta they of support financial and intellectual foreign and that each time is more active &apos; , says kunle amuwo , a researchers nigeriano .
these last months , these &apos; support &apos; had result each time more clear in the development and the speeches of boko haram or in their case operational , that now mean the use of kamikazes or equipment explosives each time more complex and the same lifestyle that the category , aqmi .
the community international , beginning , washington , is since then pressing to abuya for that have in account the problems brought , boko haram .
the authorities sympathetic , of fact , for time recital the group as a community of iluminados little offsetting of interest .

these last orientan in first place to the churches , the televisions , the administrations .
in 2009 , the fighters of boko haram were especially active and multiplicaron the attacks against the comisarías .
the reaction of abuya was , as often to , widespread .
the army atacó the city and registered 800 dead .
succession yusuf , arrested in life , receives the death in prison .

the world according the candidates republicans to the presidency
in relationship with china , with iran and with the aid to israel , mitt romney , herman cain , and rick perry vying in simpleza and lack of knowledge .
a america debilitada , the crisis , ? can manage a world complex with ideas simple or , even , simplistas ?
listening to the candidates republicans for the presidential , the electorate could think that so is .
since ago few days , mitt romney , herman cain , rick perry and the other candidates each time do more statements estruendosas and atajos in on of policy foreign , traditionally a point strong of the republicans .
extienden the lemas , to often infundamentados , on china , iran , the aid to israel .
mitt romney , the candidate better a in the career towards the designation , the &apos; cardiff old party &apos; , has threatened with to to the chinese to the wto and denunciarles &apos; , manipulation of their motto &apos; , a issue key in a america exasperada , the migration of fragmentos uncontrolled of their sector towards asia .
. as if that means the explosion of a war trade , said .
jon huntsman , former ambassador of obama in china and the only candidate that has a vision sofisticada of the policy foreign , almost ahoga to a attitude that &apos; apabulla &apos; the emotion .
has asked a dialogue firm , but equivalence , with beijing ( the position current of obama ) .
but huntsman , that is plateau in the unidentified of the polls , still being inaudible .
the lifestyle of ronald
romney also has promised a intervention military in iran if the sanctions not true break their programme nuclear .
&apos; if salgo elected , detendré to iran &apos; , fanfarroneó .
&apos; if obama its his , will the bomb &apos; .
promised also increase the aid military to israel , acusando to obama of have failed with their obligations in relationship with that partner .
the his herman cain , the second candidate better life-style , shows , their part a lack embarrassing of such subjects .
recently , instaba to to to the threat military china because beijing &apos; to develop capacity nuclear &apos; , apparently her the fact of that china already at the átomo military since 1964 .
the governor tejano rick perry , that supports to israel and want intervene in iran , says that , , their part , is now to orbiting the army us in mexico for fight against the which of the drugs .
the appeal to the torture against the supposed terrorists , banned , obama in 2009 , also what preconizan cain , perry and the cresson michele bachmann .
the differences are considerable with the candidate republicano of 2008 , john mccain , a weight heavy in policy foreign .
the opponents the current president contestan that ronald also had ideas simple and that won the war cold .
request that the own obama was a amateur and that had that aflojar the piston in on of fight against the terrorism .
insisten , with reason , in the failure of their ingenuo dialogue with iran , in the an hurried of the &apos; boys &apos; of iraq and in their tergiversaciones in libya , and what etiquetan of weak .
but the attacks not them are simple .
the population juzga of a way more well positive the balance of security national of obama , that over with laden laden .
since iraq , desconfía of the speeches military that beautiful a hundimiento .
and , argumentando that ago lack rebuild economically america for revive their leadership , obama . the impression of be more fair .
the nord stream , new door of entry the gas russian in europe
the pipeline nord stream , that comunica directly europe western with russia happening , the fund the sea baltic , already has since in service .
must supply gas for satisfy the needs of thirty million of who .
gazprom , the heralded russian the gas , has wanted so the event with great pompa .
the last tuesday , more of 500 invited , including four heads of state and of government , took to on the baltic , between the music of the orquesta and a delicate bufet , in the opening the nord stream , the new pipeline that comunica directly , under the sea , russia with germany .
symbolically , the chancellor german angela angela , the president russian a.m. indication , the first minister french &apos; fillon and their counterpart of the countries netherlands , mark rutte , have girado together the volante of the válvula that controls the entry of gas russian in the network of europe western .
with this new pipeline , each year audience 27,5 million of metres cubic of gas russian additional to europe western to through of a first had of 1.224 km that comunican the region of st petersburg with the land of mecklemburgo-pomerania .
a second tubo should concluirse to end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55.000 million of metres cubic of gas , is say , enough for cover all the consumption french .
also , already about of the possibility of build a third tubo , the same way .
for gazprom , the completion to time of this huge labour is aires of victoria .
poland and the countries baltic had theories strongly the project .
of fact , the nord stream will to allow supply gas directly to germany , any the course earth , third countries ( poland and ukraine ) .
of coup , these two countries some something of their power : for them , will more difficult influence in russia amenazándola with cerrarle the access to the markets of europe western .
in the point álgido the debate , warsaw not dudó in for the nord stream as a &apos; new pact germano-soviético &apos; , in reference to the alliance between hitler and stalin for should poland in 1939 .
is say , if the issue is politically delicate .
europe western , support the project russian , has successful a greater security of supply .
but the price is a weakening of the europe of the energy , given that the project has led a gap between the european the this and the west .
russia has known , in so only five years , do triunfar their vision of a alliance direct between russia and the countries western rich , large consumers of gas and with . reserves each time more limited .
&apos; this pipeline is a component of our partnership with russia , a new arteria that we unite of way conventional &apos; , this &apos; fillon during the opening the pipeline , proving to what point the large contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic .
all this explains the individual grins in the sides of the superiors of gazprom , many in lubmin , in the point of arrival the gas .
the construction of this pipeline also supposed a achievement technical .
the tubo submarino is made of steel recubierto of cement for protegerlo against the anclas of the ships .
supports in the fund the sea , to a average of 200 m3 of depth .
for construirlo , was necessary avoid camps of mines that traces of the second war world .
&apos; was necessary with or destroy a centena of them , , caution &apos; , out jens müller , spokesman of the society nord stream .
also , s necessary providing the measures of protection of the supervise and the flora .
the tubo is a long snake-heads of metal that low-price as 242 torres eiffel and not is cut in whole their length : not , válvulas , not , stations of peacekeeping .
was measures a platform of control in the waters of sweden , but the responsible the project renunciaron to the same the see that the swedish not were very prepared to allow that a society state russian estableciera of way permanent in the sea with to their coast .
&apos; in case of avería , interrumpiremos the step the gas in least of a minute &apos; , there jens müller .
in case of flight , the gas the pipeline liberará , , therefore , to the atmosphere .
but the builders they little likely that would a flight , since that have to junturas that , according the forecasts , will a flight each precursor years .
the control the state the pipeline does by a robot submarino , arrastrado , a per , that of inspections foreign , so as by a has that everything , the internal the pipeline .
with the way of a pure , predictability in the internal the tubo , that has a diameter of a metre , and at with the gas .
to their arrival , after three hours minutes of journey to a speed of three metres , second , except data precise on possible deformaciones the metal .
the pipeline has been designed for work during fifty years without need of no kind of reparación .
the movement the gas does simply , the pressure .
the principle is of 200 bars and , to the an of 100 bars .
five companies have uk their forces for power to to out this project .
the company leader is gazprom , that has the 51 % of the cautiously .
to she , unieron the german e.on and basf ( 15,5 % each a ) , so as the noticed gasunie and the group french gdf suez ( 9 % each one ) .
these five societies have created a company common , so-called nord stream , committed of build and exploiting the pipeline .
has their the in zoug , switzerland , where the taxation is especially favourable .
after , gazprom alquiló to this society , during a long-term of twenty-five years renewable , the whole of the capacities of transport of gas .
&apos; to gazprom you payments , the capacity total , regardless of the amount of gas that really transport &apos; , there jens müller .
the funding of the construction the pipeline has taken just in a 30 % with the contribution of the accionistas and in a 70 % by loans banking .
the cost total of the labour should achieve 7.400 million of eur for the two tubos .
for gdf suez , , example , the investment has reached the 240 million .
but the accionistas weaker are insurance of that not superarán their investment , since that gazprom moderating , yes only the risk of the expenditure .
the pipeline emerge the baltic in lubmin , in a at arenosa plantada of pinos .
. válvulas , with 4.5 metres of - , form the door of an the gas .
there few sensors that miden the pressure , the temperature and the characteristics specific the gas to the arrival , before of that owed to the pipelines germans .
since the last tuesday , the terminal receives a million of metres cubic of gas russian each time .
to total capacity , will three million , time and in 2012 , six million .
