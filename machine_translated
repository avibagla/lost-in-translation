the children overweight from in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life that not is healthy , according from the research current .
again to show what is the importance the environment where overall for a development healthy of the person , as the models that serve of reference .
in the table , the children obsesos fuel , example , of packaging the least with the double of often that the children of families with weight normal .
for night , more the 19 % of the than had cenado potatoes fritas the day before the analysis , the which is linked the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity not is a casualidad &quot; .
in the families of children with obesity not there practice of people sports , what which is applies to the most of the families current , where only the 15 % of the children did that their parents , the less a time week , are time for the exercise physical .
survey carried 900 children
the survey was to end the last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of education basic of all saw .
already was the second at the programme of &quot; the obesity of not is a casualidad &quot; , that supports the company of sure health general and the company unilever .
to now , have participated in the project more 12 billion children since the 4º to the 8º course .
a dieta appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors determinantes , that they decrease major the number of children with obesity and even obesity .
&quot; only the half of the children encuestados have answer that have five public cares according the regime : breakfast , lunch , food , merienda and dinner , that is a of the conditions in for a dieta healthy &quot; , other one of the results of the survey .
understand but with embutido for dinner
the specialists avisan of that , in a development healthy , are important , addition , the details , that also have , as example have a time set for the mean in family .
in saw , not however , only the 23 % of the families of school desayunan to the same time .
in the majority the families , each one desayuna only .
but worst was be that in the 10 % of the who not desayuna nothing .
the mean is , however , the basis of a dieta daily right .
the study shows that in the families of children than consume with many more often the insanas potatoes fritas .
almost all - whether the weight - they to on refrescos dulces ( 70 % ) .
rule general do sport more the 40 % of the children encuestados , however , pronounced their parents this result reduces to least of the half , only the 15 % .
fabrícate in dieta
the next stage the study posibilitó that the chavales elected ( 204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools ) creasen their own which to from of all the takeover possible according their matter and views .
&quot; the preference food of the children czech in age percentage between the 12 and 15 years , since the point of view of a food healthy , are very being of what ideal . &quot;
between their food their are the pasta , the meat and dulces
&quot; is on all alarming the popularity of the refrescos dulces &quot; , he in the report end the study .
as food main has the palma the pasta and still of close the meat of subsiding .
virtually , the children reject always the legumbre and the will the fish and the i is very under .
change habits made
the same time , the study shows that the children are prepared to change their habits food if they the information fair .
&quot; in the group of control of the participants in the study , that rellenaron the cuestionario after the end the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity not is a casualidad &quot; , was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy &quot; , urgency in the results the study .
is the attention , for example , what main to the refrescos dulces , where many children empezarían to preferir the water normal and aware .
the children also elegirían with more often in the cuestionario the meat of endangering and the fish to the food main and restringirían the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of harina .
the estilista has of be also a good guillermo , they the professionals
in the article introductorio , how about the estilistas , already i quejé a little of that the lessons initial already were cargadas .
not had not idea of how would what .
conferences of three professionals the ramo , how he to individuals problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world the industry .
and will worst .
as more closely are the proved end , more information and tasks practices we aguardan
and but the course develops each saturday and sunday , already not be a alfiler .
are time we studied with the director , alena , ( in the course not there no man ) on how he to the woman that not has a simetría perfect .
and is the great most .
someone is cuellicorto , someone has a on estilizada the curvas right and someone suffering obesity .
the estilista has of know possible ópticamente a shoulders anchos , alargar a bottleneck or recrear the curvas necessary
we have given certain them on how do i the body of women the kind of jennifer oxide , of pechos and caderas enormous but cintura close and the same time not vestirla of a way too desafiante
if , example , the difference between the cintura and the caderas is so that the attracted or the trousers not adaptan , is the it done coser the least a paper of intentions extra to measure .
doubt not arrepentirán , because the clothes that where well is impagable .
with a speaking to measure having much better that with a that not for of get , levantarse , baila in the cintura , etc.
the body estilizado can to he clothes with pliegues , adornos , bordados or drapeados .
there certainly many types of information various and of bodies , that i come of that have of whole the week for to order in my head whole this information .
and even , i fear that with the task asignada , already i more that the too .
to each participant in the course you have allocated two famous , to the that must look two vestuarios : one for the day and another for the night .
there that have in account the aspect current , the lifestyle the fashionable that adecue to the person in issue .
i has tocado &quot; he &quot; to miranda kerr , perhaps the conozcáis of the campaign of victory &apos; be secret .
out within , for me is a better that , example , britney spears or christina aguilera , that recently will engordado a hundred large ( favour , have in account the excessive ) , or the jovencísima selena gómez .
the pictures we that recortarlos of the weeklies or buscarlos in internet and imprimirlos , for after elaborarlos picture .
the moodboard , that is as is the result completely , this also our lifestyle staff and our relationship with the design gráfico .
is important also think in the of gráfica the estilismo .
the estilista , therefore , not viste only physically , but that also taken , example , of the pages of products in the journals ( of subjects specific , as trends , bolsos , designed , etc. ) .
of all this we spoke the estilista and leather kameník .
but all this already for the sunday .
the estilista has of have a a global .
the three invited specialists against the conference the saturday with information on all kind of bodies .
the estilista honza pokorný , the by of fashionable jakub polanka and the fotógrafo of fashionable ben renč .
jakub we reminded that the fashionable is a an and the estilista should saberle from party to this .
and a good estilista know work with a same prenda the he of forms various .
the variabilidad , in this case , fundamental .
so , the as gabardina ( or as say in english , trench-coat ) can he to what passing with vaqueros and camiseta , but also it for he the body he with shoes of tacón and fotografiarlo as if it in reality a clothing .
or well enough arremangarla and any the bottleneck for obtain a image different .
&quot; jugad with &quot; , we he .
that more valoro is the next council : &quot; to start to work , ago lack that first conozcáis all the rules &quot; .
&quot; then tell romperlas &quot; , said jakub .
end i is clear what memorizamos all these developments , what being with what , what , if then is that in the journals of fashionable we we results different .
that to of the desfiles .
you the fotógrafo ben , know that a estilista has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that to fotografiar .
so , for a history of fashionable that have ten pages ( therefore , ten outfits ) , there that have sometimes , lists for use , the less fifteen .
and also that the not the clothes works in combination with other prendas , all them different to the that overnight in the reality .
all this there that times in account to the time of such the outfit .
honza pokorný we was that the image and the lifestyle a them alone , in many cases , the half the success .
enough look to madonna , that not is precisely a as an , but the image and the márquetin have fact of she a star world .
in saw , the time , not there still a trend clear to use the services of the estilistas .
to the eventual famous also what are pointless ( i cannot my skills , my aspect physical not has so importance ) .
and when someone we pida our services , there that have in account that is very likely that we indiquen a they very different to the their real ( less ) .
then only is guglear and needs if the journals the heart already have writing on the issue , if a certain celebridad has engordado / adelgazado , etc.
the sunday , honza and we insistieron in that the estilista not enough orientarse in the fashionable , but that has that understand of outfit .
for their work , on all must communicate with the people to the that viste , what that is fundamental be a good currently .
know at to the people , not ago of least , is their views .
&quot; when a director you contrata for that you clasifiquéis the vestuario and what completéis with prendas fine , not look catch and out all what that had and say : &quot; huy what horror &quot; &quot; .
&quot; encontrad the least a couple of things that podáis ponderar and recommend to that someone the can to &quot; , says .
he same also we was that all must caber in the call &quot; placovka &quot; , is say , the stock of work .
this set around of the cintura and have all the they necessary .
are these as nail , as nail , quitapelusas , or imperdibles . there also balance of nailon ( that you it the estilista for the session of fine of products such that bolsos or gorros ) , pinzas special of enganche of prendas front , if this outside greater ( the alfileres and another kind of enganches not are permitidos , therefore could damage the fabric ) , or a game of remnant .
to not slogans in the usual pasiva and to something in practice , we learned to revestir the suela of the shoes .
even during the sessions of fine in the study , in a surface world , could damage the suela and much more still the foreign .
and not on more that revestir and revestir .
not could play the shoes with the nail for not dañarlos accident .
that had that be very hábil .
i has given a joy the who my work reserves .
the true is that not i are very well these skills .
this is only a small part the all the that we heard for all the end of week , in the second part the course .
already i i given account that help the estilismo to level professional not is a way of reflect , but i exactly as what that telling the people .
in need at speed : the run need all america .
while
a journey , in principle despreocupado , complicates to cause of a series of descuidos impropios of a journey may for the time of morning .
in certain measure to cover the expectations , but this not it of nothing , if , in reality , not intended do nothing so .
the new over , to the that the title adds the run , met large expectations already before of its estreno .
prometía that would new buenos to the former saga of to need at speed and , to result of what shown , is as a game that not should end other time a gender of action without more .
also we we curiosos know how disappeared the scenes insertadas , where the like main falling the car and rolex their own ordinary .
as often happen in the series of nfs , the results not offers great one regard to what that we those .
there to that can to volumes , but in the cómputo total some points to cause of failures absurd , that already come apareciendo in the number since ago years .
in reality not can or question errors , but that is more well of the desgana incomprehensible of the programadores .
the adventure at very well .
you kind in a history , whose leading , as , has certain problems personal ; for resolverlos , offers participate in a career illegal whole america .
you sentáis the volante in the at east , in st which , and your mission is to the first to new york .
the idea is to interesting .
the route into in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty .
of this follows that every career has place a route different and the stages are localizadas in different s , that are quite various and interesting .
of that way , one not has not remotamente the that of that the stake will always what same .
some of the part are even agradables to the view , although the level technical the gráfico is equivalent the of evidence previous of the series .
therefore , not is nothing the other world .
but the through the desert , the landscape otoñal or the high mountains covered of snow is a effect about very an .
addition , the to diversifican the time in when a element atípico .
, for example , in the desert you encontráis a storm of bit that ever the visibility .
in change , in the mountains there have care for that not you sepulte a avalancha .
according that , every a of the is very well developed .
only there a couple of models , but with enough .
during a time , intentáis adelantar to a amount of rival exigida ( what normal in a career classical ) , after tratáis of earn time ( duel classic cronometrado ) and then you expected a resolved against a only adversario .
in half of all this is to sometimes the police , that not ago but refused still more the things .
the although are the landscape outside the car .
have animaciones interactivas when as , in the most of the cases , has of escape of someone and out you that ayudarlo , always pulsando the botón fair in the time fair .
complicated .
is surprising , however , that has enough less landscape in the game of what that be wait ( in particular there only three ) .
but the result end is positive , because this element not a to be some and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements that do that the stake it more interesting .
the model of severe still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous .
that to say that to day of today already not be great one , but not can that that be bad .
if buscáis a simulación realistic , already they seek in other part .
but to a career by with quite action to be quite this lifestyle of underlined , although we find something better between the games of the competition .
to here , in order .
but the problems after of a true time .
to difference of what right of the models of underlined , already not happens what same with the another .
of games of this kind not be wait that recree deformaciones and another complicated , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not look predict how reaccionará vuestro prosecution , with what which not all is in order .
is typical that , the to a adelantamiento very ajustado or able the prosecution with a traffic normal , so only has commercial roces , but in other situations almost identical , vuestro prosecution has doing piruetas descontroladas .
or even has destroyed .
you the system of reseteo , not arise large problems , but can poneros of humour .
the reseteos are programados of such in that , when sufres a accident or you sales of the back , the game you restituye the last point of rescue in the back .
however , in each career only at of five reseteos available .
if the consumís all , you that restart the career from the principle .
therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not be well , but not is very of fiar .
to sometimes , or the reseteo aid , only aid the aprenderse the stage is the memory .
a great disadvantage the stake is that the same facts are in different places .
in some curvas , for example , there that into of a way specific ; of another way , are being of take .
other sometimes you encontráis in some get vehicles &quot; civil &quot; always with the same configuration , although estéis the first , quintos or lleguéis five minutes before or after .
this ago of rabiar on all in situations , when veis that two autos that will the i in directions diametrically , your contrincante adelanta without problems , but when llegáis , debéis girar or well direct .
is as when lleguéis , because is thing that the &quot; surprise &quot; always will front of release narices .
the former have also a advantage more .
for whole the starting llegaréis to websites where , have in account the time , always you adelantará the same adversario in the same website .
also this happens the end of the starting , in a long bridge , which is still more chocante .
vuestro oponente be to before that sort , the price that be .
when will front of fine , you difficult the vision of the autos that come of with , so that the principle can do papilla the car .
can understand the idea of create a game with maximum takes of suspense and adrenalina , but the execution is so apparent that surely you decepcione without .
and is a it , because but the model the journey be simple , the game is fun and with action , of way that to often not is possible to the detail what that is not where .
and really as , if the merit has the idea with fifty ski march or the classification in the career for that not quepa the platitude , or any other thing .
a idea inhabitual is the change of autos for the to .
you that be extremely to the surtidores of petrol the hand of the road , because exactly there you that change of prosecution , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you .
the autos into three categories .
the sport are suitable for areas urban , the autos strong american for the motorways rectas and the exóticos superdeportivos for a severe technical , example , roads of mountain with curvas .
also balance narrativo main also is a balanced of challenges parallel , is say , there to in places specific that conoceréis the stories .
here conseguiréis not only european , but also points of experience for vuestro profile , that it therefore for the challenges as the cuentos .
the achieve the level higher , the driver open several for , beginning the prosecution and acabando with funds for the profile .
the same time , there conectada a role autolog in line , that compared vuestros results with the of other players and disponibiliza other duties community .
one of the elements more difficult the understand is how is real the last career in the history .
with the car llegáis to the tunnel the metre ( allow ) , where you ponéis to to to aspects the ways ( pass ) .
the velocímetro you mark between 150 and 200 km / at ( just ) and , of suddenly , behind you a the convoy the metre and you has front without more .
in the wording surely we a discussion on this during several days , on if during the programming the game none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take a he of bobos .
the part technical the stake not is nothing so , but the least the effects visuales general are in the most of the cases agradables , to sometimes to soberbios .
because what it that , in the at more tensos reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a way serious .
this affects on all to the accidents where there involucrados many participants , when the quality of image must already not is valid .
the audio is well and the longer sonora is a question of matter .
to end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth , the longer sonora belongs to the category &quot; every one of their father and of their mother &quot; , but can mean that nobody ending the game only their music .
the that end of need for speed : the run is therefore quite confused .
if the stake evitase errors absolutely thinks , we we problems in that that the run is the better game of nfs of the last years .
the that the that the game not is completed .
the diversión is asegurada , but preparaos because the errors you might in the eyes with the force of a reflectores of airport .

&quot; heavy five , six years , before of that the situation estabilice a little , calme and the new players acostumbren to their new all &quot; , began with conviction their conference in the faculty of right the her czech to the eu , milena vicenová .
how not issue in seriously their motto &quot; clear and openly on europe &quot; , that said already in the first part of their conference , when managed under each body of the eu and their relations with as precision and clear , therefore would the envidia of many lecturers of the faculty of right of the u. carolina .

&quot; is a man that knows listen to the member of the into states , communicate with them and that has a vision clarísima of towards where must go the eu &quot; .
the new since of representative of the policy foreign and security it to from of the question : &quot; ¿ who is this eu ? ¿ to what number i llamarla ? &quot; . is therefore of a step important towards the unification and the clarification the of the union policy of face to states as china or india .
one to prohibirnos the cheese the olomouc
vicenová has he also the agenda was , still and will the council european in the future next .
the presidency czech of a two years was a success .
the czech raised of the crisis economic potential , were the crisis the gas and organised a summit for the partnership eastern .
the fall the government in at time lighthouse as a aspect very negative , that back seriously to keeping .
the representation czech in the eu has at many commitments .
in words of the ambassador : &quot; a good let &quot; , not only the presidency , but also the crisis financial , that is trying now .
another hand , there that approve the budget for seven years of the eu , caused the current situation economic , much more difficult .
if the budget is more simple and effective , ¿ what sectors will priority , what countries will support and what least ? that is something that will present in the agenda of the next meeting .
the mine reminded also their lemas main , with the that came to europe : &quot; about of europe with clear &quot; .
&quot; true is that not i which the abreviaciones feas , the extranjerismos or the jergas that the people not understand &quot; .
&quot; ¿ how can a citizen understand that in brussels not busy of truth the curvature the curvature curvos or redondos , bananas of various shapes or that nobody we will to ban the cheese of olomouc ? &quot; .
also to from more from of environment of the eu and closer to more citizens czech to the institutions european .
we expected europe of the part
according the ambassador , the czech have reputation of eurosceptics and the people is more well the aspects negative that the positive .
also , lamentó the low participation the czech in the institutions european .
the fault is of a the factors , as the modestia of our candidates , their inability for write messages of motivation , but also the little support of the czech .

the worst hands of the women : ¿ also are to you ?
if pedís to the men that are able of quote some devil classic of the women , in general every one of them the nombrará think .
dear women , ¿ you reconocéis in the lines following , where citan certain idle femeninos that obtaining do hervir the blood to the two ?
to the purchases
¿ reprocha to its average orange that has dependence of the purchases ?
¿ has that as what least a trapito in week ?
¿ like buy to often in the however ?

some women are account that should appease their pasión for the purchases , what least a little .

¿ not sound these i ?
¿ to ?
then is a of these women obsesionadas aspect .
not is that you should to of cuidarse , but many men are alérgicos to listen to its couple quejarse all the time of their aspect physical .
the sex strong also is the agreement in that as more is the often of the complaints , more molestas them the women .
the order and the up in first place
as a tiovivo infinito .
must the windows , to the aspiradora , fregar the soil , denied the dust , fregar the let and all that what least two sometimes week .
¿ you reprocha to their couple that you has pisado the soil fair with a ordinary dirty , to their children that have littered a lavabo rolls and a estantería with doors of glass that therefore you cost must ?
in case of that you sufra this &quot; customs &quot; , pruebe to be aware of that nothing should spared and that the order and the tidying surely not should should be primordiales in the family .
this i inofensivo the up could amenazar their relations and the welfare family .
to comments become
&quot; the calzoncillos funding leave with the clothes how . &quot;
&quot; your ponerte also morning these calcetines up &quot;
&quot; ¡ the trapo were not is in soil ! &quot;
if ago these cometarios to their couple more sometimes the day , will that so will take of their highly .

the women concentran in the relations , that them like about total of things the kind who , where , with who , how and what .
to what better to every a of source to sometimes escapa a small and inofensivo chisme .
with the hand in the heart , this is own the almost all women .
another hand , there women chismosas of these that not monitored , to the that them love chismorrear and what they to often , desprecian to all and are dangerous for the that the around , on all in a team labour women .

&quot; is bad &quot; .
&quot; provides the party only with a player off , the rest were noveles &quot; .
&quot; in end , but is that against not can do nothing , we that lidiar with this &quot; , said jacques martin .
&quot; therefore rotar the players the against us , not what we resistir &quot; .
&quot; had that simplify more still the stake , from the disco of our field &quot; .
&quot; and so will back &quot; , he one of the have , p. k. subban .

how have out the prices of the on since 1989
to 1989 had in the despite of then only five agencies of travel state get : čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea and autoturist .
the agencies of travel of at time vendían in the most of the cases travel only the bloc socialist , therefore the travel to west were very restringidos .
the tourists czech would , therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the opened ( republic democratic german ) , to the union soviet , ( sochi in crimea in the sea black ) to bulgaria and romania ( both in the sea black ) and to hungary ( balaton ) .
a exception positive was the period for between 1962 and 1972 , when could travel to yugoslavia , however , after the regime yugoslavo inclinó towards the west and the travel of the tourists czech were then quite restringidos .
a great concerning the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc socialist ( or be , also to the checoeslovacos ) not them permitiese travel free and processing not even the countries socialists .
if a citizen wanted travel thinks , for example , to poland or to the union soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the journey individual not was possible .
the agencies of journey ofrecían in those times also travel the west , but one should to to the eu with a together of ball and to whole the night , or have &quot; good known &quot; in the agency .
still not all was cattle .
the call &quot; promise of change &quot; that was the condition for the travel the west , not concedía to the &quot; people politically little reliable &quot; , that not could travel in all .
the currency checoslovaca not was a currency freely converted and , guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency western ) for travel to west .
the great majority of the czech experience their holiday in their own country , what that had a great number of confined and houses of summer , that the czech adquirían . this practice still still .
the way of travel of the czech has suffered from 1989 a real revolution .
while that to 1989 for us was the not is more to the holiday in the opened or bulgaria , the year last the czech did 4,5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world .
is nna great somewhat , of the that today day already not are aware , the fact of that the destination currently favourite , croatia , to 1989 not could travel freely , because was part of the yugoslavia of then .
to principles of the years 90 payment the exemption of visa for travel to the states neighbours of europe western , what that was a wave huge of visits of short an , sobretodo to vienna or germany .
the checoeslovacos , for much time , not see hartos of the excursiones the west , all the world wanted it the what least a time .
example , in paris dormían the groups of czech in the parks in shops the campaign , already that our income of then not we permitían pay a hotel or pension .
a feature typical of the czech of at time was the be because the food ( canned , front , etc. ) for save .
another at important was the introduction of the convertibilidad of the maximum czech , so our tourists were finally , after of decades , buy freely currency western .
our level of life aumentaba and with he also the wages media , that around of 1997 was a increase in the demand of travel .
with the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies , to from of 1997 with issue , to preparation the travel using the direct of flights chárter , what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thank to the possibility of obtain discounting the volume of passengers .
to end of the 90 the century last , already the czech home without visa to almost all the countries developed , are ee.uu. , what which simplificó still more our travel .
another at interesting in the history the tourism pos-revolucionario happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thank to a huge demand , the first flight direct since keeping to a country exótico , and was to thailand .
since at year , proceed all the years flights chárter direct with tourists czech was countries distant and calurosos . this winter already volará directly since evidence to 12 destinations exóticos .
the countries exóticos the their currently close of 100 billion czech the year .
another at interesting of this time , that symbolises our development pos-revolucionario , was in the year 2008 .
the 17 of november of 2008 , ee.uu. out the visa for the tourists czech , with that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world .
in 2008 the czech , first time in their history , have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50,3 % ) and first time in its history , have spent in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion czech head , including the expenditure in the website of stay .
meeting house general ordinary to choose the president , that could end of new in point died .
since ago almost five months the football czech is president and is likely that the successor of fall hašek as president of the federation czech of futbol ( fačr ) , not conocerá not after the call of the next house general extraordinary that will place this thursday in nymburk .
the fact , still not has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to continue .
the same , not will vote even to choose between the three candidates .
the interested to presidir the football czech jindřich rajchl , miroslav pelta and tomáš paclík .
hašek renunció to their office in june not without before state to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that supiese means the football in the future .
however , after of conclude the was hašek , used a controversy between the two federaciones of the partnership unable of to to a agreement for decisions a candidate common .
became in fact the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president .
the has of the house general met in vain in the house national ( národní dům ) , on in the area praguense of smíchov , because the discussions had blocked and not only in as the method of election .
not came to no consensus not in as to who in the house general had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the delegates with met powers .
to from of that time and because to this only point , in a agreement this , supported also the recommendation the institute of state and right , according the which the representation met powers not is possible .
however , the disputes on the code election still open .
more light on the situation already not could should not the committee executive that , in their meetings , ordinarias or extraordinary , all not falls nothing .
the opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the point hit still the same .
the question is the next : ¿ of what way proceed in the third round to avoid the point died ?
&quot; the dispute about in about to if must to of agreement with the estatutos or find another model &quot; , says dušan svoboda , one of the three vicepresidentes of the fačr , that , since the direction of the partnership , represents the futbol professional .
according the model proposed in the estatutos , in the third round are at candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy .
the region of last is ready to to to a compromise for that can earn at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both federaciones .
the part bohemia , however , which the condition of that the winner , according these are porcentuales , should have the majority of the least two thirds .
&quot; this quitaría , without however , the sense to the two rounds previous and negaría completely the concept of system bicameral &quot; , is as svoboda understand the concerns of the part morava , according what which what better would not play the order and vote according the estatutos files .
with what said , before , is of agreement also tomaš paclík , although is that the regulation electoral established the estatutos of all the candidates be more to pelta .
&quot; i would that votara the maximum the agreement with the estatutos &quot; .
&quot; for that not inventen no tontería about of the representatives as in the last house general &quot; , says the you of victory plzen , that postula the first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of pelta .
pelta still did .
according he , in nymburk decide on the new president and he believes that the candidate in the future cooperaran of way constructive .
&quot; all the pasiones apaciguarán with the party today of our team national in the championship european .
&quot; the football will to be leading , and cooperara more to will &quot; that the representative the jablonice , that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to level professional as regional .
rajchl is more comes .
&quot; hope that when to a agreement , but , unfortunately , the situation is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; not is the conflict between bohemios and moravos , but there see of ajustar the rules to their own convenience . &quot;
&quot; this can have as result a new definitive of the house general . &quot;
&quot; of all case , hope that band the sense common &quot; , said rajchl .
already not is a time to that all the parties them to a agreement .
some negotiations had that take in montenegro , but ¿ who can know to that start the party if the team of football will which ?
the air special , in the that had that travel to podgorica , between other the vicepresidentes dalibor kucera and rajchl , not has out this morning problems technical in prague , taking that other a alternative for carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification .
quizas the meeting decisive , for end , could be the that will place to level ministerial , that , according they , will this wednesday .
to josef dobeš , minister of education , youth and sports , like much integrate to the parties divided to the organisation sports more powerful the country for that when to a agreement .
there much in game : the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next house general the committee central of the federation checoslovaca the sport ( čstv ) that one made of a new direction the sport czech after the problems financial of the home of loterías sazka .
paclík luchará to the presidency , because not is a candidate more appropriate .
if the head of the futbolistas of pilsen , tomaš paclik , before of the house general extraordinary conociera the name of a candidate appropriate that satisficiese all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football ( fačr ) , or would as candidate to a since so relevant .
&quot; if have a person appropriate , would fighting it and not i would as candidate to the elections . &quot;
&quot; but to the day the today not has been find a person &quot; , said paclík for the agency of news czech ( čtk )
what that view to paclík to into in the challenge with miroslav pelta and henry rajchl is exactly the possibility of block to pelta , the course winner of the elections , that opens the way to the presidency of the federation czech of futbol ( fačr ) .
paclík also puntualiza that , in case through , permanecería in the office of president only to 2013 , when hoped the time of the house general ordinary .
in that office you like see to a expert and good director that not is too related with the events seats .
&quot; already i talked with some people to the that could have in account &quot; .
&quot; to me was a madness hear to some say that in this time not even want identify with the football czech . &quot;
&quot; i would change that vision &quot; , .
what that supposed more does to paclík in this time is the relationship of pelta with the president of the partnership of football regional of pilsen roman berbr , a man with a last controversial , known outside the mundillo as a poderoso lobista with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the house general .
for paclík is so unacceptable see pelta at in the sillón presidential .
&quot; in case of that gane , when the status existing and nothing in the football will &quot; .
&quot; with the support of berbra , a man of business ambitious , the football rather still least from &quot; , said paclík .
mentions also the fact of that ago a years the name of pelta was related with a much telephone for the research of a case of corruption , of the which pelta went impune .
&quot; not know what prestige to football could bring the victory of pelta . &quot;
&quot; and with what eyes we look the uefa and the fifa &quot; , said paclík , that also the with certain caution their statement previous that &quot; vendería the club pilsen if pelta become in president &quot; .
in the case of win the elections the thursday , paclík could be the cooperation with pelta in the future .
of same opinion is the another candidate , rajchl , that has been supported paclík before of the house general september that end in a fiasco .
&quot; he ( pelta ) be the first the that alleged &quot; .
&quot; is able . &quot;
&quot; i could imagine , for example , as head of the representation &quot; .
&quot; but not as director of a partnership &quot; .
&quot; i not meto the narices there where not i i able &quot; , added paclík , that in september suscitó very attention support the from of the commission of referees presidida ludek macel , potential after dagmar damkova .
paclík these that atrevería to manage the partnership .
particularly to their capacities of management of the companies private , because since the summer last is also the director the pilsen , that with their support took in may the triunfo in first division .
&quot; i force to change some things in the area of football and make to its practice safe . &quot;
&quot; for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably tend to influence in the decisions the committee his and of appeal , have situations become , said paclík without so their antipatías towards the president the sparta daniel křetínský .
a of the priorities also be the of consolidate the relationship between the fačr and the committee olímpico czech , with the aid the which ejercía pressure on the leaders political for that socrates more money the sport of the tax of the i .
&quot; is one of the problems key the that should go the new president . &quot;
&quot; if aumentaran the tax on the games of gambling , as what anuncian the parties political , would their arguments , but , frankly , have that us where is to stop all this money &quot; , out .
ademas , paclík now not has in account even its partnership with the club pilsner , although he same says that the president of the fačr must be &quot; not an &quot; .
pelta is to time related with jablonec and rajchl with dukla of prague .
&quot; not an . &quot;
&quot; but not see sense the fact of yield done my actions the club of pilsen to other person for then to there after a year and half &quot; , said paclík .
pelta promised to the fačr new estatutos acabarían with the point died of the elections .
two days before of the house general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency , miroslav pelt , promised that , in case of be elected , effective that the fačr had a new estatutos that sirvieran definitely for right , in the future , the controversy in as the regulation electoral .
the representative the jablonec is set in as to the meeting of this thursday in nymburk , and believe that the conflict preelectoral could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football .
already before of the elections not made in september , pelta promised look , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in certain funds .
decided participate in the last minute in the last house general , what that this be of two months could go well for defend and present , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management the football .
&quot; the people of all the levels taken the football already ago a time and expected of this thursday the new president . &quot;
&quot; feel that has come the time of that someone gestione the partnership &quot; , think the man that demands mainly with the club of jablonice , but that worked in the sparta and in the committee executive of the partnership .
this reason , believe have enough experience to manage the football czech .
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that increase in the time of fall hašek .
&quot; unfortunately , in the house general of june were adopted the estatutos that not were so planned as all themselves . &quot;
&quot; if excluimos certain interpretations , we a president already since september &quot; , would pelta .
exactly the readaptación the document more important of the partnership continue usó as señuelo for who to the parliament .
&quot; if i eligen president , i what counts as a challenge personal and i now to respond in case of that this falle . &quot;
&quot; is a question of principles , the which not we there &quot; , says pelta .
also , in theory , to not fight with their opponents .
already in the last had your that was working with henry rajchl , the that respects their training in right , aware of that their oponente would also their first of .
already was much time attack to he paclík who , the contrary of pelta , not he larger with head .
&quot; more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes . &quot;
&quot; their attacks but were vergonzosos and many people became amazed the campaign election . &quot;
&quot; that many of them dudan on their real nature &quot; , said to their maracaibo pelta , that still being faithful to the statements been already in september .
their weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , since the competition more low to the with .
this last should be escaparate promotion of football .
&quot; also , intentaría right all the escándalos that such to cause of the bohemians as result the scandal of corruption the year last . &quot;
&quot; immediately after i involucraría in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , to ensure that has enough money for all the football &quot; , said ago two months to the čtk the candidate of 46 years .
to continuation also promised that appointment as president the football not comportaría no change personal of the plantilla .
&quot; would that know first the tasks of each he &quot; , said she to strahov where , after a long period of anarquía , has a nerviosismo united .
to despite of the scenarios looking current that vaticinan to the next house general , he believe that the delegates not will in vain this thursday to nymburk .
&quot; if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , doubt what we overcome .
&quot; the football needs credibility , the which will only if end has a leader &quot; , still two days before of the working more decisive in their career of representative , pelta still did .
rajchl them , that under its leadership , the fačr empezaría to work with wish .
if in the quarter house general its elected the current of jindrich rajchl as new president of the partnership of football czech , many people will surely resentida .
rajchl would that , in case of be elected , trabajaría hard .
to implement a change systematic and do that the member the committee executive are responsible of each area the football processing .
also goal to resolve the case of the bohemians , improve the relations with the uefa and the fifa , to more money for the football and continue with the work on the previous president fall hašek .
&quot; as president , i would help completely the football &quot; .
&quot; since the contacts international with the uefa and the fifa to the selection , happening the football professional or the greater of young futbolistas of high performance . &quot;
&quot; with this not i say that what would only &quot; , said rajchl in a interview for the čtk .
&quot; i a player of team and i stick the powers the committee executive of as way that every member can their to a area should . &quot;
&quot; and asignaré tasks difficult for that the football can , in every one of these segmentos , to forward with a momentum &quot; .
&quot; to many people this probably not you gustará , because move start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others &quot; , added .
because to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement futbolístico , says that has have the possibility of not stand the new as candidate .
&quot; all know , to work 20 hours just . &quot;
&quot; but need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that i would and obstaculizará to each step &quot; , he so the for of its indecisión .
&quot; very people i has said that not i asked down , because then advice vencidos also the others &quot; .
&quot; is of have faith for not leave , more &quot; , said .
according say , you could also continue the work that already began with hašek .
&quot; during these two years , end a great part of work that not i that now along &quot; .
&quot; there processes that had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not i like that someone the pare &quot; , announced concerned the fact of that , if eligieran the another candidate , miroslav pelta , the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of hašek .
&quot; i believe in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , mirek pelta not is capable of keep .
&quot; behind of he is on all all that people that ocuparía the football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected . &quot;
&quot; i can reprochar a lot of things , but not the fact that i to favour of someone . &quot;
&quot; to be aim . &quot;
&quot; i do a football for all , because only sentirán well all and not only the elected &quot; , said rajchl .
is also the idea that only serious karlsbad the president .
&quot; although some people seeking that what contrary , i in mind do what maximum caused . &quot;
&quot; example , is time of think in the fact of destroy the second division in a part czech and in other morava , whose winners irían to the first division &quot; .
&quot; not would the situation current in the that we only three equipment of moravia , that represents a problem for the players moravos young &quot; , said rajchl .
although to the pugna of the elections presidential sumó tomaš paclík , president the club pilsner , rajchl not is the believe in their possibilities of be elected .
&quot; still i have a strong support of the federation czech , the which i was as its of and that know that behind of me there successes clear &quot; , said rajchl , whose successes understand the saving of tens of million of billion of contracts desventajosos , the negotiations of contracts televisivos and the negotiations on the law of the i .
another hand , recognised their part of it in that the federation not is united .
and while claims that pelta is &quot; descalificado for to the confidence in the football czech &quot; , as the another trading , paclík , as a candidate strong that has something that offer the football .
&quot; nobody can see that was a great work the pilsen at year &quot; .
&quot; in the case of that be elected , probably will what that already began fall hašek and not cambiaria of way significantly the plantilla the staff in the committees . &quot;
&quot; not i use that my favour &quot; , evalúa to their rival rajchl .

no another any was more clearly to the turks that live here that there a threat specific and , to the germans , that the mistrust and the distance can desembocar in the violence .
the attacks agudizan the sense of group the part turkish .
not repeat the errors the last
in the press turkish listening then mainly the minor of the policy german after the attacks , helmut kohl denies to visiting to the survivors of mölln .
after the attack with way of fire of solingen sent a telegrama of condolences the president turkish and klaus kinkel , their minister of affairs foreign , sustituyó in the funeral of cologne . kinkel detalló in their speech what that contribute with the tax the turks of germany .
is clear how estimated the value a person according the amount of their tax .
the information current of the means turks again to show what circumstances that is , since then , the mistrust of many germans of origin turkish in the legality of this country .
also the effort of a explanation a and of a revaloración the terrorism of extreme right in germany , this time they lack words francas .
the bank the scandal the along the zurich
the bank more arriesgado europe not is in italy not france , if not in switzerland .
the ubs almost been in bancarrota in the crisis financial and since then deslizó of a crisis to the as .
now at a german .
sure that axel sources not what had considered .
after of their witnessed starting of the summit the bank federal , in july through that in 2013 comenzaría in a new and almost also of witnessed work : president the council administrative the great bank much ubs , a inesperado and state step in their career .
axel sources am should , considering switzerland their beauty and to the ubs their would acquired strength and is fall comments amables on their future colleagues .
&quot; the easily has achieved a or &quot; .
&quot; i am with with kaspar villiger and oswald grübel &quot; .
in september became clear that all be different .
a operators financial of the easily in london prevented all the systems of security the bank and defraudó 1,7 billion million of eur .
oswald grübel , director general of the flash , a banker not only known in switzerland , had that they .
the president the council administrative of the drives was since then also tocado , and all asked : ¿ when a axel max ?
through that sources must advise the bank since february of 2012 .
and will office the presidency the council administrative in may , not to principles of 2013 , as the bank comunicó the tuesday .
this is hard to axel sources .
not is banker , more well , professor of economy and consejero and has had a period of adjustment be necessary .
of coup ago responsible of the strategy of a bank , that has of again to prove that deserves the title &quot; the greater bank the scandal of europe &quot; since ago time .
a part , the easily is enormous , to ago little was the greater administrator of goods world , and other part , since ago years , desliza of a scandal the next .
nothing , so what seems , ahorra the changed so proud bank blessing .
he crisis financial .
the easily was a reputation excellent to 2007 .
the image the administrator of goods much discreto and sound , but also mañoso , combinó with objectives ambitious , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investment .
a part , with 1,6 billion of dollars , the easily managed more money of customers wealthiest that any another bank the world .
and other part , avanzó as bank of investment in the league of the large banks the world .
impresiona .
hans geiger , the former banker and of professor of banca in zurich for many years it : &quot; to my students , always i described to the easily as model of a good bank . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view current , one question : ¿ how could equivocarme ? &quot;
was in a mistake .
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very in the drives .
to middle of year , better wuffli , director general , that to then was have as a banker genial and very intelligent , resigned quickly .
some months after , sospechó the right .
the fund of investment the bank embarcó in losses with titles of high risk and had that amortizar thousands of million .
for should with this , the easily announced a inyección of capital of nothing less that of 13 billion million of frf .
for this found investors , course that some miraran with action to little before : a fund state asian and opaco of singapore and a fund state arab , so discreto , that never had heard its name .
this was only first d .
april 2008 , empeoró .
the bank had that should the loss of thousands of million , marcel ospel , president the council administrative , in 2006 in the second better paid council administrative of switzerland , resigned .
in october of 2008 , she the disaster , in view of their investments wrong , the ubs found in the crisis financial to the collapse and had that be rescatada the state .
the bank national compró values problem to the ubs many thousands of million , the confederation helvética was six thousands of million of frf a bono reduction tell , by the that convertía in copropietaria the bank .
all switzerland was affected , said dramatic that was this for a country small , if aloja to banks so large .
finally the sum the balance of the ubs in 2007 was more of five sometimes that the results economic of switzerland ( see gráfica ) .
&quot; not we return to big to the ubs &quot; , said geiger , expert in banca .
the first disaster joined the second .
few months after , the ubs capituló in a conflict tax with america and was ready to therefore the data of the customers wealthiest , that possibly had defraudado taxes with aid the bank .
also , whereby a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars , large of profits injustificados of these business with a compensation payment .
with this , the ubs confesó more or less have helped in the fraud tax .
thing lost something that had been since always its capital in the competition customers rich : the aureola of discretion .
after the scandal , the secret the bank much already not is the same .
to this rise the called the president of the junta directive and the president the council administrative .
and the currently of the funds of the customers .
of this way , in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central : in the banca of investments by the speculation flawed and in the administration of property by the aid the fraud tax .
and fair when readjust to be something more pace , fair when i that the ubs back to this , is this desdichada history the operators , a operators individual defraudó 1,7 billion million of eur , before of that the bank diera account of that something was .
and desveló , seen , this still not works well with the management of risk in the banca of investment .
&quot; with the case adoboli that the controls of risk have changed too little &quot; , says martin janssen , professor of economy and finance in the institute take of the university of zurich .
the director financial of a great bank german also is sure : &quot; the problem of the ubs is that not r the controls the risk &quot; .
what that about the idea of the caution , with the that the bankers become were since ago time , be the watch of the over goods the world : no risk too large , in change , the security the money to quebrar the another on of the republic came .
the second of security of the banks become were the symbol of the reliability inquebrantable , as lindt and sprüngli the chocolate genuine .
the central of the ubs in zurich not furthermore with the buzz the hardest bank private swiss , only is a little greater .
the situation is targeting .
the bank has their the main in the street bahnhofstraße of zurich , that will since the station main directly the along of zurich , enmarcado the summits covered of snow of the mountains suizas .
here the buildings are ostentosos , the sells are a of the more higher of europe .
here are joyerías as tiffany`s between business traditional their as the confitería sprüngli .
here they since ago years the banks their : since the bank national , happening the de of credit suisse , to the elitarios banks private as julius bär .
enter in the room of reception of the ubs by a heavy door chair .
within the walls are revestidas of mármol , front are large sillones of such , with the logo the bank there a great letrero for point the &quot; security &quot; .
the ubs know what that the other search here : security .
the two large banks become , the ubs and credit suisse , in some time have desplazado the idea the great bank swiss , or the have betrayed , as view the president of a small bank private swiss .
prefer not read its name in the newspaper , the end and the out ago , as all the bankers their , also with the business of both large banks .
the ubs has fact too large , view , mainly in the banca of investments , where the continental have won ground .
the swiss not had nothing more that say .
&quot; and have have for a time to the our of the continental . &quot;
of fact , the ubs changed the banca of investment with , concerned their first great proposed and then wine the disaster , no entity financial european had lost therefore money in the jungla the high risk as the great bank swiss .
the 15 of october 2008 , the disaster was clear .
&quot; that wednesday the coalition government the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of its nation &quot; , says the author lukas hässig in its book &quot; de ubs-crash &quot; ( &quot; the crash of the ubs &quot; in spanish ) .
the political over to 68 thousands of million of frf or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur to save the great bank of the bancarrota .
¿ how they is ?
about with the bankers their , are the problem in the dimension of the ubs .
in june of 1998 , two of the three large banks their fusionan in a poderoso consortium .
from a bank that , because to the merger , was too large for the small switzerland , and still it .
what that was for that the two different banks precursors of the ubs complementaran : a bank puerto but doesn with the centre of the administration of goods in zurich and a internacionalización more poor but more strong .
of suddenly , the banks of investment internacionalizados came of way well with a money , with the that they do rodar a great bicycle financial .
there two names related with this takes of the ubs : better wuffli , head the consortium of the ubs of 2001 to 2007 , and marcel ospel , then president the council administrative .
&quot; always i wuffli and ospel were a team perfect &quot; , says the expert in banca hans geiger .
&quot; wuffli , the intellectual , modest , that understand a of models and statistics , and ospel , the intuitivo that managed could step since the learning in the bank to the summit . &quot;
finally , ospel fió wuffli .
and the end wuffli was probably a mistake decisive : &quot; he that their models were a reality &quot; , says geiger .
&quot; is a case she . &quot;
tragic , .
is clear : the desatino before the case .
the employees of the ubs remember clearly of the meetings of forced , in the that wuffli , the head the consortium , always repetía the same motto : down the seat to goldman sachs .
the bank american was the bank of investment poderoso the world .
encabezaban the &quot; league tables &quot; , the clasificaciones then documentaban the success of the banks .
the ubs to be in summit .
some steps within well .
in the operations of divisas and in the negotiating actions was in more high .
however , the net of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak : in the business the interest international , in the language of banca &quot; fixed income &quot; , there a compensation huge for the large banks .
the ubs vacíos in the products hipotecarios american .
for fill these vacíos , the ubs started a adventure that almost costs its existence .
or the growth , invirtieron therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investment american of high risk .
into in a machine powerful to titularizar appropriations hipotecarios american and venderlos to continuation , manteniendo certain risks to account own .
and also , as other banks at the bajada for a time .
&quot; in summer 2007 , as the market real american was in llamas , the ubs compró there &quot; , said geiger , expert in banca .
so large the euphoria , as circumstances the fall .
a managing had that go , already that the attempt of one s more complicated of that were .
jobs in the ubs became in seats proyectables and are inseguros to the today .
currently , who at a great bank , has a work almost impossible .
must find a strategy for a bank , to the that all the models of business lógicos are stumbling .
geiger , expert in banks , has a idea , to end to the banca of investments , focus in the administration of goods , back to the roots suizas .
the bank not want to so far ( still ) .
but the banca of investment must reduce much , is clear currently .
the next thursday , sergio ermotti , the new president the bank , will future strategy the world .
in reality , only was in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a solution came , already that the bank the bank separó quickly of their predecessor grübel .
meanwhile , he imposed : must to of way permanent the business of the ubs , comunicó the bank of zurich the tuesday .
ermotti to restore the bank of investment to their state to the of the nineties .
makes 3.500 jobs .
but not enough .
the ubs be a vision .
¿ ?
¿ with what to earn money ?
these are the questions that sure ago axel sources currently .
to the time only says that first buscará a housing with woman in zurich .

the mr englund a i and journalist swedish .
also is the new secretary permanent of the academy swedish , that granted the prize nobel the literature .
that has writing here is a book little aware , that describes , rightly , as &quot; a work the anti-historia &quot; .
contains some names triumphs , treaties important or dutch battles ; virtually not there ambassadors , elegant journalists or further on holdings or material .
not is therefore a book about of what happened , it , as &quot; a book about the how happened &quot; . is about of &quot; feelings , from , experiences and states of humour &quot; .
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; being the experiences in times of war of more or less 20 men and women ordinarias , to both both of the war , since colegialas and botánicos to escaladores , doctors , drivers of approximately and administrative .
some of these people convertirán in should .
some convertirán in prisoners of war , or than their member , will indefinite or morirán .
their lives parpadean here as velas votivas encendidas in a church ; a new they to the a while other go .
the book the mr englund is a customs of the books of history standard .
is also a correctivo to the notion of the first war world only was the funesta war of trincheras in the with western .
&quot; the surrounding and the pain of the battle &quot; at of way limit to through of other teatros of war : the alps , the balkans , the with eastern , mesopotamia , africa the this .
to the soldiers in this book them will above the colmenas ; one is the christmas in egypt under the pirámides ; the disposed tse-tse are a problem intratable .
is a book conmovedor , almost since the start .
the war inunda the lives of these people as a disaster natural , a hurricane speech that apesta to cordita .
when the ceasefire of artillery as in the distance , and replied a woman that is in house with your children , ¿ you quedas or huyes ?
of all forms ¿ next ?
almost no understand what that is happening , or even what has that fight this war .
&quot; we of facts &quot; , noticeable the mr englund , &quot; has rellenado with conjeturas , suposiciones , hopes , scares , ideas fixed , corporation of the conspiración , dreams , pesadillas and rumours &quot; .
&quot; the surrounding and the pain of the battle &quot; still to individuals as florence farmborough , a nurse english in the army russian , and richard stumpf , a young marinero german of the fleet of high sea .
their stories have were in their greater part of drives , letters and another material already published before .
the explanations of their lives can be aterradoras or conmovedoras , but are more display of life in the accumulation of small at , details around , the mr englund .
many of these are about of privaciones and of bust with that there .
about the have the history of a colegiala german says : &quot; sucedáneos , all parties sucedáneos &quot; .
&quot; sucedáneo of coffee , too untrue , rubber of imitation , vendas of role , botones of wood . &quot;

there , elsewhere , &quot; 837 exist permitidos of the meat in the production of salchichas , 511 substitutes the coffee registered &quot; .
stories are about the honour and the value .
a american recognised their own momentum towards the who and to about of the war : &quot; sientes that , after of all , this is for what that the men are designed and not for drawing in sillones with a cigarro and a whisky , the newspaper of the later or a impact seller , and removing that that paints means civilisation and that not there a barbarian behind of that pechera almidonada and tachonada . &quot;
in change a soldier british account of that probably morirá , and of that no enterará or importará .
&quot; a time that one resigna the thinking of sacrificarse , to one like think that could happens front the public &quot; , says .
in change , is horriblemente it &quot; to a condemned estrangulado in secret &quot; .
other comments are about of a old europe soon , and about of new types of terror .
&quot; the conflict has become every time more in a competition economic &quot; , it the mr englund , &quot; a war between factories &quot; .
that the arrival of what that he is &quot; a new kind in the bestiario the young century : the murderer in mass elocuente and convinced ideológicamente with ropas of good textiles that executes their fighters while is at behind of a escritorio &quot; .
the people means of ways imprevistas ; are therefore behaviour innoble as heroico .
the mr englund about of the soldiers that us actively s a disease venérea of prostitutes as way of you the service in the with .
&quot; the expression more need of this can see the trade of state gonocócico , that the soldiers buy and embadurnan with this their genitales with the hope of end in the hospital &quot; , says .
&quot; those that are truly about what frotan on their eyes , what that to often place to a ceguera of life . &quot;
in this translation the swedish real better serious , the prosa the mr englund ágil but not extravagante , is perfectly adaptada to their task human .
in dozens of small scenes that the way in the that the war to &quot; up forces excepcionalmente incontrolables : nationalism far , revolution social , hatred religious &quot; .
the people starts to ask what their leaders they are doing combat .
the best books about of the first war world to often have been indirectos , as the great war and the memory modern of paul fussell , or novelas as innovation in the with of erich maría remarque , in time of stories integrales .

the union of workers support demandará to the city the redundancies
the union that represents to hundreds of workers of support school that lost their jobs the month last planning exceeding to the city the wednesday , accordance that the redundancies were plain and discriminatory because to their impact desproporcionado on the schools that atienden to students poor .
the demand is , possibly , the last weapon to available the union , the district municipal 37 , in its effort revocar the redundancies .
seiscientos seventy and two building of the school , the all of parents and other employees that were between the worst paid of the city lost their work the 7 of october , in a movement that the leaders trade have to as a venganza policy their negative to allow , the spring last , the access part of the city to a fund of assistance health to office of groups of work for close their gap budgetary .
the authorities municipal have denied categorically that they .
in a hearing in the city the month last , the consejero of education , us m. walcott , said that the redundancies were a part the budget approved in june .
a member the council contraatacó him that nothing in the budget especificaba that the member the staff of support of the school would leave .
officials the district municipal 37 said that were the complaint writing , advirtiendo the department of education of that would demanded . will a conference of press the wednesday for announced the presentation official of the demand , in the court supreme state in manhattan .
the demand include the sr. walcott and the department of education of the city as accused , and account with eight workers following as advice , all them women this or latinas , the as that the majority of the assistants that lost their jobs .
elizabeth he , spokesman the department legal of the city , said that the city not had seen the demand and therefore not could do comments on their claims specific .
according a draft of the demand were the new york times , the union has focused in the number of redundancies in the schools of areas poor of the city for support a complaint treatment unfair , saying that the schools poor lost more assistants , already that had been insuficientemente kind of way of .
out that if well not there redundancies in staten island and a few redundancies in the schools in the upper east side or tribeca , 17 assistants schoolchildren lost their jobs in the district 23 in brownsville , brooklyn , and 46 were following in the districts 8 and 9 in the southern the bronx .
taking in account the loss of five of the eight assistants employees the school public 36 in harlem , where the 68 per of the students live in the poverty , the demand says , &quot; this not is a area of parents wealthiest that be certain funds for cover the deficit budgetary &quot; .
p.d. the budget the district 36 reduced in a 3,26 per this year , and also lost money when the city changed the way in that estimated the funding additional for every registration student poor in the schools .
the union also says that the directors of schools imperative can have been unaware the language in a memorándum that forming the learn of the coordinators of parents .
the memorándum his the word &quot; surplus &quot; for under the action , to despite of that &quot; surplus &quot; describes with greater often the act of enterprises to a master of the nómina of a school to a stock of work , whose just are paid the office central .
&quot; sixty and six all of parents were work &quot; , says the draft of the complaint , &quot; and not only in surplus &quot; .
mission despite , the congress prepared for come to a agreement on libya
seems that finally republicans and democrats in the capitolio are prepared to only agreement on something related with the embargo in libya .
all what that needed was that the which had success , that the laid dictator muamar the gaddafi outside sought and murdered and the participation of states united came to their end .
the tuesday , the committee of affairs foreign the senate will to be a resolution , patrocinada the president john kerry ( democrat massachusetts ) , with with the senadores john mccain ( republicano snow ) and i. lieberman ( independent connecticut ) , aplaudiendo to the who their successful which and to the troops of ee.uu. their &quot; courage &quot; .
&quot; this resolution is for honrar to the valientes of libya , the start to rebuild country &quot; , said kerry .
&quot; is a claim support bipartidista for their aspirations democratic . &quot;
the language can it inofensivo , but nothing on the debate on libya has been easy to now .
this summer , the legislators of both parties peleaban between and with the house white on the significant of a series of resolutions for approve or reject the role of the military of ee.uu. in the mission of the nato in libya .
in june , kerry and mccain by a resolution that forming the use limited of forces military of ee.uu. in libya .
the project the law was derrotado in the house a broader for bipartidista , and that never came to votarse in the senate .
but the same day in that the project of law was rejected in the house , the house also rejected a measure that would recortado the funds for the operations in libya .
what he the mission of ee.uu. in a kind of going legislative - with the congress what enough people as for criticise the within part of obama of the mission , but not so enfadado as for in reality segar the hierba under their feet .
continuation , the indecisión the congress was superada the events .
trípoli fell in hands of the rebels who in august , and gaddafi was murdered the 20 october .
the mission of the nato end officially the 31 october .
now the senate could be completed for act .
the resolution the committee of affairs foreign &quot; welcomes the people of libya their tremendo courage and extraordinary resistance for explained to ourselves &quot; and &quot; considering to the men and women of the forces armed of states united and to their partners of the coalition that took in operations military for protect the people of libya their extraordinary courage and professionalism &quot; .
the resolution also &quot; states the interest national of the states united in a successful and strong transition towards the democracy in libya . &quot;
¿ are the new measure the completely support of the commission of affairs foreign , or dividirá to the legislators as did the project of law of june ?
the last version was rejected the senator richard g. ( indiana ) , the main republicano the committee .
the spokesman of said the monday that not had seen still the version end the new project of law .
the another on the capitolio , the house is to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget employee , a priority legislative for almost all the congresistas republicans and some democrats .
the measure , patrocinada the republicano bob goodlatte ( republicano virginia ) , will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another issue that of fact logre a vote of whole the house in the house or the senate in this congress .
other legislators not have had success to the time for do to their amendments to the house , but not lack of especially .
the of goodlatte is only a of the 68 amendments constitutional that have wonderful in this congress , that abarcan a wider range of issues .
some are duplicados - the same project of law proposes therefore in the house as in the senate - and other with small exchange between .
there what least 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the house , and another handful that &quot; be the expenditure federal . &quot;
some of these projects of law also are idénticos between , but are to their patrocinadores - on all republicans rather that are refinar their currículums - the opportunity of jactarse of that them were the &quot; authors &quot; of this measure .
the law of control of budget , that was adopted in august , requirió that therefore the house as the senate voted a amendment the balance budgetary .
in march , 58 senadores voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of amendment .
more beyond the budget , several member want limit the number of mandatos that the member the congress can to , while that the representative josé e. serrano ( democrat new york ) , to denied the limit of two mandatos for the presidents .
the representative jesse l. used jr . ( democrat illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments that an the right to a education of quality and attention health , between other subjects .
a amendment that prohibits the marriage ordinary is a proposal perenne , as a that prohibits the burning of flags .
some legislators also want to the seeking of the laws federal if are been two thirds of the states .
so enthusiasts that have been the member to the time of propose amendments , not are seriously to a pace more quickly that in years previous .
in the 111º congress , the legislators proposed 77 amendments , and by 66 in the 110º .
the pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the the of 1990 , when the member were regularly more of 150 amendments each two years , according figures proporcionadas the library the senate .
but not had much more success then of that have now .
the last amendment that added - the 27 - was void in 1992 , but of fact was proposal the congress in 1789 .

&quot; but seems that the only way of that some join their support is put to us in the role of souls desamparadas . &quot;
the issue is a issue very sensitive for the leaders military , that not want it desagradecidos or in disagreement with the public the that serve .
also they account of that the ira to the that enfrentaron the troops that were in the last years of the war of vietnam was a worse .
as result , the most of the discussions on the lástima have to out in silence and in private between the veteranos of war .
after of that their two children were of combat with the infantería of aware , the colonel withdrawn mark cancian them warned of that the people from of the military considered their service since two prospects .
some them mirarían with a sense of fear because to that enfrentaron to the that and they to places exóticos .
other preguntarían if would a &quot; off enojado and as below of the surface &quot; , said cancian , that fought in iraq and came to a work of high level the government in washington .
during their search of employment , said , felt that some entrevistadores had was sutilmente if would capable of aguantar under the pressure of a allows work of washington immediately after of their this of combat .
&quot; when hablas about the your service , necesitas to with to the from negative &quot; , reminded cancian contándoselo to their children .
from the allow military , in part , of the fighters us towards the wars .
the achievements in the field of battle are rarely time elected for the alabanza part of a country that has little familiaridad with the military and is few profits direct of the wars the iraq and afghanistan .
&quot; us , as nation , already not we the heroísmo military the ways that were the all common in the second war world &quot; , said the deputy general withdrawn david barno , who comandó the troops of ee.uu. in afghanistan .
in change , the praise of the political and the public hours in great measure in the depth the suffering of a member the service .
the troops are recognised the number of giras that have soportado , the number of friends that have lost or the the of their injury .
the army afronta a growing pressure for end with the of
this week , a hearing historic decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army their conciliation out to the violation .
if not , hundreds of so are among for the next .
the soldier of first elizabeth lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in the that it says that was subsequently a about .
was october of 2008 , and schuman of return to their legutiano in the basis airline miramar , the north of st diego , after of the dinner with a friend when found with a colleague that was a package of 12 latas of beer .
he asked if could joining to she in its room for take a cup .
&quot; sonó a signal of alarm &quot; , it lyman .
however , the nativa of texas he to a on its concern .
i , , has 19 .
&quot; is of texas &quot; , .
&quot; may have heard to my shared . &quot;
to the few minutes of into in the room of lyman , the man acercó behind , tirándola towards from and violándola , so .
this week , the 18 of november , lyman and other 27 member the personal military current and old expect ansiosamente a decision legal in a trial historic that will in arlington , virginia , that decide if the demand that have interpuesta against the exsecretario of defence robert bill and their predecessor , donald rumsfeld , fare to trial .
the demand does that garage and rumsfeld top in the reduction of the violation widespread between the military , in violation of the rights constitutional of the soldiers .
tabled in february susan burke , a who of washington , d.c. , the demand discussed at to 17 advice , but creció to 28 in the months following , 25 women and three men , all them claim that were violados or agredidos sexually their colleagues , and that the army owned to the time of investigate , assertion , or instruction justice appropriate after of the supuestas subjected .
burke says that is to the flat greater the army , because the problem beginning with them .
&quot; the army is a structure of down to from &quot; , says .
&quot; ¿ who are the people that are in conditions of eradicate the culture of the represalias ? the high if . &quot;
burke also says that since february , have since in contact with it close of 400 them more , many of the which could be part of future demands .
their strategy : in place of earned to all the advice in this case , by all the eggs in a same basket , so say , is to present several cases , of be necessary , for keep the pressure .
the team of the defence for the department of defence , encabezado the tax federal armstrong macbride , has tabled a motion for presented the case .
the documents the court , results newsweek , detailed the strategy of defence -en essence , that the military not can be demandados soldiers current or old the injury violations in the forces armed .
a judgment the court supreme of 1950 call the announcement feres , the government federal not is responsible the damage sufridos the staff in service active .
&quot; the damage alegados are part of service military of the so &quot; , say the documents .
the department defence refused to do comments for this article .
the things have changed from years 50 .
while that to the women still them is official been serve in combat , this distinction is only call : the wars modern rarely time have clear the lines the with .
therefore in iraq as in afghanistan , the teams of women soldier are desempeñando all every time more important , particularly for to to the women local in areas of war .
the result : between these two wars , 150 women soldier have died and two thirds of them in situations the which .
is time of that the army also modernice , says burke .
it not is single in its fight , and other three demands are in , also the their .
in the faculty of right of yale , the clinic of services legal for veteranos is preparing a case against the four main being military supposed promote a environment misógino .
other part , the organisation without mind of profit vietnam veterans of america is his a demand against the army that on in the reached of &quot; nuisance of the status &quot; allocated to the victims of violation with the end of them the high the service -un remaining common , according the activists , as anu bhagwati of the network of action of women in service , a group of rights human .
their group presented a demand in december against the administration of veteranos , acusándola of practices leading in the way in that attacked the complaints of profits for the people that say have been agredidas sexually in the service .
have tabled nine projects of law separate in the congress part of a a bipartidista of senadores and representatives , for a series of corrections .
in 2010 there 3.158 if sexual denunciadas , according the office for the prevention of the aggression sexual and response the department of defence .
without however , the violations are made infra denunciadas , and the own estimates the pentagon , that figure in approximately the 13,5 cent of the 19000 incidents ladies that there that year .
the report , published in march , also considering the nation of prosecution : in 2010 , a 20 per of the cases denunciados in the army was to trial - the half that in the system of justice civil .
the advice in the case of burke , describen their attacks as only the first of a series of there .
in the case of lyman , furthermore the presunta violation to the police military least of a time after of that ocurriera .
that night , says , asked that contara the details of their violation 11 sometimes various to a a of police , doctors , and staff .
it discussed to a kit of violation , and the blood of their agresor -de a court in their brazo- was discovered in their bed .
six months after , in april of 2009 , lyman saw to a hearing to a judge , during the which asked about of that would had relations sexual with their novio the day the attack .
six people they as we of status in name the alleged author , that was finally absuelto .
&quot; i the day in that his the two &quot; , says lyman .
&quot; i that i was to go to work -me i shouting since the room . &quot;
&quot; i put in the unit of psiquiatría , and when i , i that i to my official of whose , &quot; &quot; that not was their trial . that was my trial &quot; .
to lyman you warrant visiting to a psiquiatra military , that finally you severely a nuisance of the status , what that the was not apta for the service .
in january of 2010 was dispensada the service under terms menos-que-honorables , that from receive any benefit .
in as to if the case tabled lyman and their colleagues of demand continues , is a possibility very hits , says john turley , professor of right in the faculty of right george washington .
without however , , &quot; in my opinion , should be able of continue forward &quot; .
what that interpone between them and a differ is this announcement that has been criticada since that published first time .
i been a critical permanent of the already feres .
the army is decades behind because not has the same incentive and acting that with the responsibility .
and adds : &quot; the back are very in against of them ... but is important for them try . &quot;
these things only from when the people good is ready to fight .
if the hearing not will their way , burke , who of the so , will to the eu to their other hundreds of advice for cases future .
&quot; we to fighting against the army in this issue to that the reform would &quot; , says .
&quot; or to that we muramos , that happen first .
the walls have eyes : how the researchers you are looking in facebook
before the become in the new face of the extreme right in europe , anders behring breivik was simply another kind that aireaba their points of view anti-inmigración in line .
the monday , breivik , who admitted have done a killing in norway in july , that he 77 dead , faced to their first hearing legal public .
while breivik can have action only , was far of be only in the ciberespacio : had last the greater part the time that preceded to their attack with to its computer , charlando with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in networks social .
after of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted to more about of these people .
, ¿ encontrarlas ?
easy - only you that into facebook .
&quot; we we account of that not was so difficult to to them &quot; , says jamie bartlett , author main of a report published recently on the populism digital european the centre of studies british let .
the alijo of information personal of facebook is so enciclopédico , says bartlett , that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising to determine their characteristics demográficas deseadas with a precision scientific - the way that the sellers have state being during years .
the team of bartlett found half million of fan of the groups of right in all europe and then them dirigieron announcements , but in place of vincularles to a new longer or product of dieta , the announcements invitaban to the users to complete a survey that he on their level education , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future .
the to to through of facebook , bartlett and their colleagues were able the to to more of 10.000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries european - all without out of the office .
&quot; is a way new of do a research &quot; , says bartlett .
some of the results not are the all surprising : the supporters in line of the groups right tend to be young , men and enfadados the immigration .
without however , in a kind of drawing , &quot; those that own their activismo in line with the activismo outside of line are more reasonable , more democratic and least violent that those that remain behind of the screen the computer &quot; .
the work of let is only a example of how facebook is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists .
centres of research , researchers doctors and scientists political are being the website for to all , since problems of health to trends social such as consent in the &quot; i like &quot; , messages in the walls and regular of state .
with more of 800 million of users active agregando a average of three parts of content the day , the &quot; supernova of data &quot; of facebook is certainly a booming of the research , pushing the number of jobs academic with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years .
for some researchers , the surrounding the facebook is that you allows to to the people to the that not podías acercarte with a carpeta in the street .
&quot; before , when intentabas encuestar people the party national british , was very difficult identificarlos . &quot;
&quot; tendrías that go to through the party , and they never you creation the access &quot; , says bartlett .
&quot; facebook would all - you to them directly . &quot;
other say that the get could provide a way of identify and address the problems of salud-social .
a study recent done the doctora megan got , of the university of wisconsin-madison and their colleagues , found that the students it that they of their hazañas of borrachera in facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that go in silence on the issue .
seaside suggests that the colleagues of the students , such as the advisers residenciales , could control the website and intervene for help to a student that publish too regular of state with their binge .
&quot; not you try a problem if not what you diagnosticar &quot; , said guillaume christakis , the co-autor of nice and director the centre of health , behaviour and development the child in the institute of research child of seattle , said the washington post .
&quot; we found a way of identify children in risk that another way not would diagnosticados . &quot;
facebook also is constantly &quot; pinchando &quot; to own population to obtain data .
the team of data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of st on , the expectation of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of wish national ( mainly being the information to the that can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago much time that maintain that the website should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research ) .
however , the users of facebook know that the website them is looking , them whether or not - the sacrificio power playing the scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website mine your information personal .
but ¿ what is when the users of facebook spend to be part of a survey that or even know ?
while that the researchers have guidelines well year on how up their data outside of line , in line is a barra free for all .
&quot; not i that many of the users have considered even in the fact of that a researchers could be examining their profiles &quot; , says armstrong selwyn , a todd the laboratory of knowledge of london , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of facebook of students .
&quot; in that to them give , was only between them and their friends . &quot;
then is the question the methodology .
even outside of line , not there guarantee of that a issue of research this completely honest .
in facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and the messages the wall are truth .
&quot; what that dices in facebook and that described outside of facebook are two things completely different &quot; , says selwyn .
is that that , to despite of their years as scientists of the technology , selwyn believe that a sujetapapeles and a bolígrafo are the best tools of research that nobody can use .
&quot; not there substitute for into in the world real and to with the people real &quot; , says .
&quot; the research social is that is on social - and a lot of social still is outside of line . &quot;
&quot; cold and inhuman : anders behring breivik ago first of public in the court
anders behring breivik , the man that confesó be the which of the two attacks that killed to 77 people in norway this summer , has to to same as a combatiente of the &quot; resistance &quot; for its first emergence public in the court of oslo .
&quot; i a commander military in the movement of resistance norwegian and in the have templarios of norway &quot; , said to a room full with 500 people .
&quot; i am the court , already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology the hatred and because support the multiculturalismo . &quot;
&quot; i the facts but not i session guilty . &quot;
the judge torkjel nesheim was to breivik for this monólogo , because &quot; not wanted to to breivik the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that exprese their points of view &quot; .
the same reason refused to allow to breivik , that brought a speech writing with up , house to the family of their victims the end of the hearing .
nesheim also warrant to the police keep to breivik under custody during 12 weeks more , you banned the access to the media of communication during four weeks , and said that the authorities should that have a narrower control on all the visits and the correspondencia during eight weeks .
around of 30 them and family of the victims represented to the hearing .
some came with the hope of look to breivik to the eyes , other to confirm that is recluido under key .
all laws with the aim of move towards the conclusion .
&quot; i that seemed cold and inhuman &quot; , said a superviviente of utoya to the station ​ ​ norway nrk .
&quot; was you , but for me was a step forward after the see and hear the suspect . &quot;
clothing with a suit dark and out blue , breivik remained calmado and professional to what long of the hearing and miró to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when she and went the building .
to despite of the strange notion of breivik of be part of a movement of &quot; resistance &quot; greater , the judge determinó that not is a ill mental , and said that not there evidence of that while with cómplices .
is possible that to some they consuele that the attacks the 22 of july makes be labour of a extremista in place of a group of radical .
but that not suaviza states the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feel .
&quot; i would that into a monster , but not what seems &quot; , said a family of a victim .
&quot; would much more easy if what into . &quot;
7 lessons of the interview up of steve jobs , show in a theatre this week
after the death of steve jobs , the 5 of october , was some that compararon with henry ford - distinguiendo the out of the technology as the great inventor modern .
but what that the fan of apple could find more position , in a interview to jobs recently redescubierta to the that has desempolvado as advances of a series of proyecciones special in the over markets this week , is how about this mind creativa about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products .
was without doubt a designer , soñador and hippie autorreconocido , but also was a ordinary meticuloso and a yonki of the diagramas of flow - a man that i that many place sufrían &quot; a disease that is in think that a great idea is the 90 cent the work ... &#91; but &#93; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product . &quot;
in 1995 , bob cringely was developing the series of television the triumph of the nerds ( the triunfo of the idiotas ) on the albores the computer personal , and did during more of a time with jobs for a can and rarely conversation .
in that time had last parts 10 years since that jobs had been forced to leave of apple , and already working hard in their new company it next , waiting the adoption popular of internet .
while that a small part of the interview of cringely used in nerds , said that the original of the interview existing for its transport .
was only after of the death of jobs that found a copy full in vhs in the bill the director .
this material of closing , slightly reeditado , is the basis of steve jobs : the interview up , of 68 minutes , that a to the cines landmark this wednesday and thursday .
for someone known odiar the interviews in depth , jobs here seems quickly now to forward their appeared tecnológicas and strategies trade .
and pensativo .
in four points different to long of the interview , there large silencios between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of reflexiones , where jobs is sopesando clearly their thoughts , for precision .
also there at in the that the perfeccionismo of jobs its to the surface , where seems impaciente because to the questions of cringely , empujándole to go more quickly towards the issues or arguments of greater importance .
filmado before of the was of pixar , the ipod or the iphone , there something extrañamente profético in the interview up , when jobs evalúa what that is that other companies do well and , and offers their own vision the future of the it .
a thing is read assessments póstumas of the career of jobs , but there something oil and inspirador in the jobs that we here , the soñador ansioso the on of the may .
he a vision of as can and must be the things .
not much after of explicarlo all with detail here , was and did .
a quickly short of seven secuencias significant of the interview up :
on how aprendió to a business :
&quot; to what long of the years in the business , i always he : &quot; &quot; ¿ what as things ? &quot; and the answers that you are of way invariable are : &quot; oh , that is only the way as ago &quot; .
no know what ago what that ago , in the business no think in the things very deeply .
that is what i .
jobs the detail their efforts for simplify the accounting of apple .
desconcertado the way in registraban the costs - to often beginning with a &quot; cost standard &quot; that was to an of good cubero , and that then line with a &quot; one &quot; - developed a factory automatizada that aseguraba that could determine the costs trade the detail .
on the it pope :
jobs narra the &quot; box blue &quot; that he same was with steve wozniak - a has that did to the people hackear effectively the company telephone and to on to long distance free .
has writing this about the has , but the euphoria of jobs here to under the box blue as a act of empoderamiento is contagioso .
describes how he and wozniak probaron the cash by the use of a telephone public , doing a call , and then conectándose since a network of at &amp; ts to other , while creaba a bucle with the greater amount of satellite possible .
&quot; were envolviendo the things around the world a average dozen of sometimes and gritabas to through the telephone public and heard a minute more later the telephone public of the door of the on &quot; , says jobs with a risita .
&quot; we young and what that this was that could build something us ourselves that could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world . &quot;
us two , not knew much , but we build a thing small that could control a thing heralded - was a lesson incredible , and not i that never have been apple without it .
jobs continues describiendo a joke gloriosa that he and wozniak almost fall , llamando the vatican to through of the box blue in half of the night and regulating about with the pope , while was their better imitation of henry kissinger .
to measure that several member of the hierarchy catholic were convocados in half of the night for about with the diplomatic us , the two estallaron in carcajadas fair before of that the mismísimo pope outside been for go to answer the telephone .
on enamorarse of the technology ( and the sale telephone with bill hewlett ) :
to the age of 12 years , to the hunting of parts of spare for build a contador of often , at to bill hewlett in the on telephone and was a call .
little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes , jobs to a employment of summer to time work in hewlett-packard .
&quot; that was a remarkable influence on me , was the only company that had seen to that age and formed my vision of that was a company and well that trataban to their employees . &quot;
jobs became after in one of the employees of hp that they the laboratories of research the the company in palo high , where was &quot; the first computer of table never fact &quot; .
was so large as a systems , had a small screen of tubo catódico , and i enamoré of he .
conseguiría a journey to hp as girl and lose the time with that machine and escribiría programmes for she .
improvisar the innovation :
in several points of the interview , jobs about about of trying new products on the into .
soon in their career , already that he to sell a handful of mr basis , you asked a client if could they all the team .
working with only 30 days of credit , had that told the montaje and the over of the equipment acabados .
more later , while was in apple , they the struggles to the that faced in the development of a ratón of computer :
&quot; i agreement of have arguments dramatic ... i gritaban that be five years &#91; for create a ratón that costaría 300 dollars &#93; , and i harté and i i outside and i a designer .
nineties days after , had a ratón that could build 15 dollars and that was completely reliable .
on the companies losing force :
much before of that liderara the you of apple , jobs proféticamente northern the way in that many leaders of the industry tropezarían in its vision , and perderían the control of their share of market .
&quot; i that trabajas in ibm or xerox , what that as fotocopiadoras and impresoras best , ¿ and what ? &quot;
you has the monopoly of the share of market , for that the company not has more success .
the departments of sales and marketing increase the success , what that are this class of people the that end to the companies and the people united of the products are expulsadas the forum for the the of decisions .
the out of the products that was to that position of monopoly pudre fault of people that not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge the about necessary .
that is what happened in xerox ...
xerox could have adueñado the whole the industry it .
could have been ten times their size , could have been the microsoft of the years 90 ...
were defeat of the victory .
on the innovation as expression those :
&quot; there a enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... to measure that evoluciona the great idea , changed and overall . &quot;
you a about of the sutilezas of the same .
there calling that you that do - some things that not you do that do the electrones , the glass the ago , the robots the do , the factories the do .
you that keep 5000 things in your which - these concepts - ajustarlos all the time ...
the end all reduces the will - down to try exponerte to what better that a team of human has fact , and then try of according these things to the that your you doing .
associated said that the good artists fast , the large artists roban .
never have had shame about steal large ideas .
what that in part was large the macintosh was that the people that were working in he were musicians , poetas , artists , zoólogos , ad , that wrong were the best scientists telecommunications the world .
if not outside the conclusion , could be doing things maravillosas in other camps .
scalia and he cenan with the rival of the law of assistance health while the court accepts the case
the day that the court by met to door closed for at the question politically controversial of if aceptarían the challenge to the law of assistance health the president obama , two of their officers , antonin scalia and clarence he , were agasajados in a dinner patrocinada for the signing of lawyers that expondrá the case to the high court .
the occasion was the last thursday , when the nine judges met in a hearing preliminary for look which the petitions of review .
one of the cases in question was a demand such 26 states failed the reform total of the assistance health adopted the congress the year last , a law that has been a out of war for the activists conservatives in all the country .
the officers acordaron admit to exercise the demand and , of fact , expected a need historic of 5 hours and average for march , and the result probably enturbiará still more the career presidential of 2012 , that will in plenary of in the time in that the decision the court man .
the lawyer that comparecerá to the court and alegará that the law must be desechada will probably paul clement , who was as tax general of ee.uu. for the government of george w. bush .
the signing of lawyers of clement , bancroft pllc , was a of the almost two dozens of companies that ayudaron to patrocinar the dinner annual of the society stronghold , a group that for many years into to the defence of the principles legal conservatives .
other signed that patrocinó the dinner , jones day , represents to a of the associations trade that desafió the law , the federation national of business independent .
another patrocinador was the for farmacéutico pfizer inc . , that has a huge interest financial in the result the dispute .
the dinner took in a hotel of washington , hours after of the hearing been the court on the case .
between the assistants was , between other , going mcconnell , the republicano more important in the senate and a maracaibo declared of the law of assistance health .
¿ the were special in the dinner ? scalia and he .
not is nothing new : the two judges have state formation to events of the society federal during years .
and not is something that between in conflict with rules ethical .
of fact , the judges are exentos the code of for that applied the actions of the officers federal lower .
if not what they , could said that caerían under the code canon 4c , that says : &quot; a judge can attend to events for because funds of organisations relating with the law and other , although the judge not can be a speaker , a invited of honour , or put in the programme of such event . &quot;
however , the proximidad absolute of scalia and he to two of the bufetes of lawyers in the case , so as to a company with a huge interest financial , was enough for alarmar to the activists of ethical in the government .
&quot; this impressive gap of the ethical and fighters towards the code will in against of the demands of several officers that everyone the court the same rules that apply to all the judges federal &quot; , said bob edgar , the president of common cause ( cause common ) .
&quot; the judges were agasajados in a desperate of funds the by with lawyers that have cases outstanding to the court . &quot;
their emergence and assistance in the desire of funds for this event undermines any demand of impartiality , and is unacceptable .
scalia and he have shown little interest the criticism that say that mezclan too easily the activity the court with the agenda impulsada groups as the society federal .
and the wife of he , ginni , is a leading encountered conservative .
other part , the conservatives argue that is the magistrada elena kagan , the that has a problem favours , not scalia and he .
kagan worked as procuradora general of the administration obama when tabled the first challenges legal to the law in the court the first instance .
their critical have administration for that kagan signing of see the case , saying that was too involucrada in defend the law as for now be neutral .
kagan not has given no indication of that will to do .

the aerolínea emirates calls 50 planes of double steps boeing 777 , with option to 20 more .
look also sold six planes look dreamliner to oman air , a operation valued in more of billion million of dollars .
rarely time is news when a company provide a asked of 50 units of their product .
but is a great compromise when the company is the manufacturer of planes making co. and the price of sale for the 50 planes out to a record of 18 billion million of dollars .
is so large as the place of where making received the order : east half , a mine of gold in growth of future orders of planes .

then , the monday , boeing said that oman air had asked six boeing 787-8s , the called dreamliner , that history of a savings of fuel and a services for passengers such .
the price the sale for six of them is more of billion million of dollars .
&quot; this has clearly a huge effect positive for look &quot; , said the forced of morningstar neal dihora .
&quot; the quality of these they in particular is very strong . &quot;
many audited of east a are property of their nations productoras of oil .
what therefore , not only have the money for pay the planes , but that a increase in the prices the fuel - general harmful for the lines airlines , because is one of the over costs - not is so harmful , because the country is gaining money with the increase the price the oil .
that is important because have least back that other airlines of cancel or delay the orders of flight when the prices the fuel increase , said dihora .
&quot; have a protection natural &quot; , he .
the asked of the emiratos solidifica the leadership of look in the market of planes of fuselaje wide and aid to keep to raya the attempt of their competitor airbus sas of making their dominance with the air of passengers a350 .

&quot; a cut so large , applied of this way indiscriminada , would that the greater part of our projects naval and of construction not be result - not can buy three cuartas parties of a ship or a building - and damage seriously other efforts of there &quot; , wrote panetta to the senadores .
&quot; also we veríamos forced to apartar to many of our officials civil of way involuntaria and , because to that the reduction impondría with so quickly , is almost sure that we that licenciar civil with the end of to the aim . &quot;
&quot; these changes romperían the faith with those are our army and dañarían seriously the good available . &quot;

&quot; is a tiger of role , a army of cuarteles , buildings and bombs enough soldiers prepared for to the mission &quot; , said panetta in their words of opening in the pentagon .
&quot; is a force that suffering the low moral , the preparation inadequate and not is able of be the day with the potential former . &quot;
&quot; in effect , being the aggression ... &quot;
in a apéndice to their letters to mccain and graham , panetta enuncia new details of how the lower &quot; generate important risks operational : too in the time of answer to the crisis , conflicts and disasters ; limited severamente our capacity of be you and committed is in all the world ; and is a risk unacceptable in future operations of combat . &quot;

as with a lie
a iris to the headlines more recent we that med serious and curse are the deception and the lie in the life daily .
the candidate presidential republicano herman cain is he intercambiando accusations of harassment sexual with several women ; each part accused of lie to the other .
the administrators of the university state of case have been accused of perjurio supposed conceal reports that had that a you of football withdrawn was agrediendo sexually to children .
the week last , the president french , she sarkozy , was &quot; pillado &quot; with a off open saying the president of ee.uu. , barack obama , that the first minister israeli benjamin netanyahu is a do .
to has destroyed to and convulsionado countries .
the congresista new york and exhibicionista in internet , anthony weiner , was the ourselves with their desmentidos quickly rebatidos for the test irrefutable .
the former candidate presidential john edwards has been accused of regulation in the funding of the campaign relating with the encubrimiento of a relationship extramatrimonial .
and , of new , nobody that what viviera olvidará never the circus mediático up the president bill clinton the lie during their second mandate about of their relationship sexual with mónica lewinsky .
are very extendidas the up on the traps in the proved of the school and the university .
have given cases in the that the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students with the end of be better seen in their assessments of performance .
mentores that should be enseñando contrary are sending the message of that lie and is are community .
¿ how deception we are ?
in a day who , the studies show that you can european in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes .
that sure , many of these he are lies piadosas .
other study was that the issue mentían three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of conocerse .
detect lies , or &quot; the location of lies &quot; , is a as essential that we acquire all , reasons therefore personal as professionals .
far of be a game of table similar to , example , charada , where the aim is exclamar : &quot; you i &quot; , the detection the deception is a an the knowledge serious based in data scientists achieved for the last six decades in prestigiosas universities that held projects of research in depth , especially in psicología and fisiología .
one of the results of the research is that the old mitos about the lie have been rebatidos .
the mentirosos who to the eyes .
not tartamudean , balbucean , ruborizan or inquietan .
not can conclusion not that the mentirosos are difficult of detect or simply .
a detector of lies holds can to to the truth taken about of the structure of the declaration , the expresiones microfaciales , the training of questions and the times .
i several years sondeando the descubrimientos scientists on the deception in the spectre and always shining body the knowledge , and was clear that the detection the deception is a technical modern that is easy of learn and aid to steer our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations .
the good mentirosos have the as of read well to the others , deal feel to will , manejando their own emotion and sintiendo of way intuitiva how the were the others .
know the research that the extrovertidos mienten more that the introvertidos , that the men say more &quot; lies win towards ourselves &quot; , while that the women say more lies &quot; win towards the others &quot; -- normally for protect the feelings of someone -- that the people married mienten less responding to their partners that the people that not are married ( but the lies that usually say tend to be &quot; enormous &quot; ) .
also know that if you is just as a malhechor , the others sentirán least ourselves the mentirle .
¿ know if someone is mintiendo ?
first , event the behaviour her the highly .
this is &quot; create a line basis &quot; .
aid to provide points reference for measure after the changes .
variation the position the highly , risa and feature showed .
is better that will if someone normally golpetea with the ordinary all the time for not to accusations upon when see the feet golpeteando in half of the meeting .
to continuation , busque groups of behaviour public , verbales and not verbales .
states to these groups of behaviour as signs of alarm , not as test of deception .
the people that con can freeze the part higher the body the try of remember their history , can emphasized their feet towards the door , inclinarse towards a an , change their position of way significantly or exhibir a &quot; desahogo postentrevista &quot; -- that haven suspiro of alivio and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have over .
to often the interrogadores they see falsamente that the interview has over only for seek that alivio postentrevista .
also passed attention the vocabulary the highly .
behind peterson metió the pata to the fund and usó the time last while tenders that their wife murdered was viva , lanzando a search of it to level national .
the people that con also can use a language distanciador : &quot; not i relations sexual with that woman ... the señorita lewinsky &quot; or repeat a question difficult fully .
the indicators verbales common are sutiles .
someone can use a lot of &quot; language been &quot; when says to a question difficult : &quot; good ... to say truth ... to that i ... to my understand . &quot;
this ago that the answer be a percepción in the of a fact and is to often a signal of warning .
not there no formula mágica to detect lies , but develop skills to be the deception is possible .
these skills improve the possibilities of who for avoid be victimizados the artists of the opportunities in their lives professionals and personal .

desalojada a finca okupada where the macrofiestas
the invaders had adueñado 11 of the 13 strip the building , in balmes , 51
the 12 ocupantes red the finca the at of yesterday offer resistance
all seems point that the pesadilla that living the neighbours the 51 of the street of balmes has come to their end .
twelve people abandoned the at of yesterday only the inmueble that held illegally , and where organizaban macrofiestas that desesperaban the vecindario , order legal and without need of a intervention police .
when end the operation , changed the cerrojo of the door to avoid that repeat the situation .
&quot; to from of now be a control of access &quot; , said the administrator .
the okupas , that had rally 11 of the 13 strip the building -el rest are habitados- , were whole the plant we and part of the the water , also of paint the walls and to waste of all kind , on all latas of excess excess .
the three first strip were the stage of the parties multitudinarias , that duraban to two days and desesperaban to the inquilinos .
the hand the building there a discoteca , balmes 51 , that also has seen adversely .
their role , maria pantinat he to europe associated that since that the building was he the business has down a 80 % .
the role of the discoteca current that the invaders of the finca doing competition unfair , already that vendían the copas to three eur , while in the discoteca valen 10 .
also , the role the local of leisure had had that to to complaints vecinales noise , while , according pointed , the bother not the their the customers of the discoteca , but the inhabitants of the home okupada and , on all , the assistants to the parties that organizaban there , that had increased their often and modern in the last weeks , according the enojados neighbours of the area .
the responsible of the discoteca he that the deal were so large that even came to a agreement with the you the inmueble and ago nine months that &quot; perdona &quot; the for .
the issues urban also this that for the recent weeks had received more complaints of neighbours the situation .
the president the group municipal the pp in the city , alberto of díaz , had edgar the week last &quot; desalojar of way immediate the inmueble for end with the problems of them and civismo that is to the neighbours , so as the exacerbate of the area &quot; .
the leader popular he that before the summer only had a floor the building occupied , but to what long of the last months the okupas had gone their in all the plants the building and in almost all the strip , and that in one even have been seas .
in this sense added that , &quot; is to end with the impunity and be good against the incivismo that has led in the finca &quot; .
also yesterday , mossos desalojaron a building nou barris .
to the 15.30 hours the police alongside to the 35 of the street of mont-ral , after receiving the call of a neighbour that had seen that four people accedían the building .
the four were arrested in the time .
¿ park or the ?
the architects line in the opportunity of the call more beyond of after on his
the an municipal on the 16 doors reabre the debate on the role of collserola in barcelona
amediados of the 80 , in plenary of of the already extinta of will of barcelona ( cmb ) , this administration imprimió a pasquines of promotion of collserola .
the folleto definía the mountain as the great park of the barcelona will .
is , acompañaba of a compared , in figures , with the central park neoyorquino .
with the death of the cmb , in 1987 , the park the to situarse , in the an of many , as the limit higher of barcelona , the capital catalana of the few that not orientan in the which norte-sur but down ( mountain ) -abajo ( sea ) .
the rating of collserola as park natural competition in this idea .
the reference not was central park but yellowstone , with the jabalís in the role the oso yogi .
in these was to that , in september , the city convocó a megacompetición an 16 competition for other so doors of access to collserola .
a door planned to the idea of park , doubt .
or that or someone is to doors the field .
the question its one : collserola , ¿ very or mountain ?
the contest , therefore their it merely organizativa as that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects barceloneses .
is almost already a issue recurrent the that it hand when two member of this former form of elected recognise in a lift .
and this fact ordinary , exactly , to a of the few coincidencias between what that people three architects barceloneses , and teachers it , that have tabled .
miguel roldán , daniel mòdol and marta bayona : the tender is right .
for roldán , after addressed the with coasts &quot; ago necessary &quot; discuss on &quot; the with of mountain &quot; , whole time that the speech of ildefons cerdà , the of the premium greens , not has taken to out .
&quot; be from of the basis of that the park more marine of barcelona is the a .
between other things great accesibilidad .
collserola is more complex &quot; , judgment the within for who the title of &quot; doors of collserola &quot; within a &quot; trap léxica &quot; : not there that think in them &quot; as the accesos to a park , but the delimitación of a areas where there that act &quot; .
mòdol , as roldán and bayona with experience in the world urbanístico , as the proposal &quot; challenge intellectual &quot; with &quot; some dangers &quot; .
dangers derivatives of what &quot; uncertain that is today day tried the space public &quot; after the experience vivida in the 80 and that had in the area the fòrum &quot; their best the cisne &quot; .
the first fear is the own delimitación borders on where can build .
&quot; limit something is them already the next step &quot; , is say , sobrepaso .
&quot; there that think in new instruments urbanísticos , the planning , because the current &#91; in reference the plan general metropolitano ( pgm ) &#93; can to ordinary to auténticos disaster &quot; .
more ceñido to the question , mòdol view that , simplificando , the it vallesana of collserola &quot; can should as a very , the of barcelona , not &quot; , a question merely topográfica .
mòdol reminds that already there a work fact the patronat of collserola that &quot; not must fall in together it &quot; , although thanks the opportunity that the council offers to their gremio of intervene in this project &quot; since the first time &quot; .
and still more , understand that the cercanía of the mountain with the city is the produced that allows to the architects into in the debate , but &quot; doubt &quot; on if is this profile technical the that must lead the equipment multidisciplinarios ( &quot; all a likewise &quot; , urgency ) that have had that create : &quot; the architects should be only a tool &quot; .
bayona nothing that the answer to the question that title to this one is complex , because in the foundations the contest lack a vision global of collserola : &quot; have much 16 competition direct -dice- in the sense montaña-mar , but not there a reading longitudinal , that see and understands the area in their whole &quot; .
this from , the less in their case , that has choice participate in the 16 senior .
of another way , a project for a of the doors can chocar in programme and definition with the the within of the door of the on .
in their opinion , that , the city should ensure that the strip immediately higher to the round of dalt should envisage , in whole their spread , a area of equipamientos that efectuara a do transition between the city and what green .
casino perdona jonás larrazábal and possible free
then of 72 days of arraigo , the before legal the casino network otorgó the forgiveness the brother the mayor of monterrey the process that was presuntos chantajes
then of remain 72 days denied , manuel jonás larrazábal nothing in freedom then of that the hold legal the casino network you otorgara the forgiveness to the who second criminal of district , that still a process blackmail against the brother the mayor of monterrey .
then the attack the casino royale , the you the casino network , sergio gil diego , was public a series of photographs and videos in the that presuntamente manuel jonás requirements the payment of a share economic for that the city regiomontano allowed the operation illegal of the home of betting .
after the nor public , the procuraduría state was a process criminal against the brother the mayor panista and the 2 of september was arrested and hold 30 days .
then of four hours to the or the ministry public 3 in crimes patrimoniales , was really to the home of arraigo 1 , within in the area former of the capital the state .
in that place permaneció for the 49 days to the dictársele a second order of arraigo then of that the or the ministry public desechara the crimes of cohecho and crime organised .
the 19 of october was made the criminal of cadereyta presuntamente chantajear with a million and half of lightweights to the owners the casino network ; without however , only permaneció hours in the reclusorio of after security already that were threats of death in their against .
the authorities you allowed to the trial internado in the confined municipal of st she of the garza .
the 25 of october you cell order of aprehensión the secretary the who second criminal of district , george yánez , who said that to almost two months of averiguaciones comprobaron enough evidence for determine the assumed of jonás , such as the collection of 1.5 million of lightweights to the representatives of the home of betting to change of allow the operation of the same .
this monday , the sign legal of casino network , vittorio aldo garcia gómez , out to the juzgador josé luis pecina to apply the forgiveness for the brother the mayor regio ; what that in the next hours could to their freedom .
during the diligencia legal , the or the ministry public adscrito the who , ramiro satisfactory , cuestionó to diego gómez if had repaired the damage and who of the partners of the home of betting was the that otorgó the forgiveness , although the lawyer tried aside the name .
with basis the considered 197 / 2011 make the forgiveness legal to jonás larrazábal and in what sucesivo not will stand complaint any in about the process that you was ; also of that not exigirá reparación of damage not punishment .
after the hearing the hold legal of the home of betting , close of the 15 : 50 warrant the immediate freedom of larrazabal bretón .

also notificará of the order of freedom immediate that issued the judge .
the secretary dionisio publishing jácome details of accident air where lost the life the secretary of gobernación , which blake , and seven people more
the secretaría of communications and transport ( sct ) informed that the results onto on the accident where lost the life the secretary of gobernación , which blake mora , and seven people more , show that the grant impactó of way direct on the ground in full integrity structural , without that the pilot could try a landing implications .
during a conference of press , dionisio publishing jácome , secretary of communications and transport , mentioned that before of off the aeronave , the pilot discovered that the conditions of climate were the right for business .
&quot; the elements that seem point that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the aspas had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselaje &quot; .
also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people , what that had with the requerimientos necessary for carry the staff .
addition , said that in the research made in the area the impact not reporta the emergence of parts in the ground .
&quot; in a for our that not there parts or single of the nave in another place , the impact presented of way structural .
&quot; the design the single was for 19 passengers , had with requerimientos suitable for trasportar to the passengers .
the ground is a outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees the there .
the time , the secretary was that is a priority have with the results before possible ; however , the research can last several months , even could achieve a year .
their part , gilberto oxide roberts , director general of airports and services revelations , assured that the time the impact , the hawk the state greater presidential operaba in speed of cruise and that this happened in a ground blando ascending .
&quot; this information strengthens the hipótesis of a operation normal the given the time the impact &quot; , expressed .
in the conference of press , the wheat of the sct , publishing jácome , enumeró six element relevant in the research :
on about :
with to the normatividad sector the flight was under the rules of flight about , this means that the tripulación must have visibility during the flight and the ground .
are likely :
the reportes in the aicm ubicaban conditions right the sleep , with is the aeronave towards the area bordering between the df and the state of mexico were ground of nubosidad to low level .
cannot seleccionadas :
is likely that the conditions of nubosidad the tripulación has buscada a area of will providing and greater visibility towards the valley of cuernavaca .
people the impact .
the coordenadas of impact and the last registration of the aeronave the like line , probably before the impact not there loss of control not at in the very of flight .
dispersión of remains of the aeronave in a area it :
the information available to the time it mean that the impact happened in a very straight and of on .
the patrón of dispersión of remains of the aeronave it mean that the single impactó in the ground in conditions of integrity structural .
not has been fact of ceasefire or explosion :
in the website the are are revelarse evidencias in the remains of the nave of some kind of explosion or ceasefire .
the last results of the research show that could have had are contact with the ground .
during the jobs of field have found parts of the aeronave to a course of 9 billion 200 feet on the level half the sea , the ground is a outstanding that will since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of there .
the photographs are the sequence in the that expected desarticuló to long of said way .
the information provided elements that seem indicate that the single could have had are impactos in the ground .
after of the search way in a area more wider that the website acordonado , around the accident , not have found parts over of the aeronave , what that strengthens the presumption of that the impact presented in conditions of integrity structural .
mss opening protocol for means gene of obesity
at the sure social a research to be the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in specialists the ipn
the institute mexican the sure social ( imss ) announced that at a research to be the gene of the obesity in children and young , of protocol &apos; genetic of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , that will have with marcadores with the obesity .
in a release , the head of the unit of research medical in bioquímica the hospital of especialidades the centre doctor national century century , miguel cross oxide , he that by a team multidisciplinario of doctors , nurses , nutriólogos and workers social .
said team is supported specialists and a of postgrado the institute national of health public ( insp ) and the centre of research and the studies advanced ( cinvestav ) the institute politécnico national ( ipn ) .
in the research invited to participate to the population be or not derechohabiente , come to the units sporting participants the imss in the valley of mexico , where have to out the evidence to the age , all the i to from of the 8 : 00 hours .
skills that the protocol started in the unit with cuauhtémoc ( state of mexico poniente ) and that since the 8 of october , the activity has to out in the unit sports nezahualcóyolt ( state of mexico east ) .
a time that question the aim of together to 500 or 600 age , the study promoting in the unit integrating independence ( south the district federal ) and finally in the unit sports morelos ( the north the district federal ) .
he that the purpose of this research is know the security and the importance of the genetic with regard the development of the obesity and identify in children and young interest factors of risk for prevent the emergence of diseases disturbed degenerativas .
the we this 14 of november the day world of the disease , precisó that the objective is together to three billion children and young between six and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , for the implementation of cuestionarios specific on food .
also they preguntará on the activity physical and background heredofamiliares of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that desencadenen padecimientos as disease or issue renal .
detalló that the i them applies to all the participants measurements antropométricas ( weight , enormous , circumference of cintura ) , the of pressure blood , determination of the levels of glucosa , triglicéridos , colesterol and insulin and genetic ( search identify genes that asocien to the obesity child ) .
cross oxide pointed that this research attack to the concern of the professionals of the health the alarming increase of weight in the age .
&apos; the surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 signal that in so only six years there a increase , in the case of the children , of 77 per in obesity , and of the girls of 47 per ; in terms of obesity also observed a rise dramatic &apos; , skills the specialist the imss .
pressed that the justification for the search of the marcadores sustenta in that the population the country from of other its history genetic .
informed that in average , the mexican has 65 cent of inheritance when american , 30 cent european and five cent africa and this condition however in the genes that take to disease and too of weight .
he that of way general , the genetic of the obesity arising in the inability of baby the too of energy that consumimos ( lowcalorie ) and that stored in way of blubber .
the were he that the benefit direct for the participants is the assessment due of the children , what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity .
even , said , the presence of pliegues of colour obscuro ( acantosis ) in bottleneck and antebrazo , that that the likelihood of that padezca alteraciones metabólicas and to prediabetes .
the information name of way confidential , the doctors the entregan writing to the parents , to who them it every a of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life that must to for prevent diseases .
cross oxide he that there three single main that cause obesity , obesity and other padecimientos crónicos : the sedentarismo , that is the lack of activity physical daily , remain the greater part the day at with the television and use media of transport in place of i travel planes .
also must to the high ingesta calórica , is say , the greater consumption of excess azucaradas , of carbohidratos ( tamales , bread , pizza , clones , etc ) with high content in tallow and protein and the genetic that analysing in this protocol .
town of the unam evitaría pretty
herrera , scientists of the faculty of chemistry of the unam , develops asfaltos which with polímeros for produce a a with better every , regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature
if the signals that are the pavimento like demands , not would necessary reparar close of 200 billion pretty every season of dry in the area city the valley of mexico , warned raphael herrera nájera , researchers of the faculty of chemistry ( fq ) of the unam , who assured that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a pavimento asfáltico is the appropriate , the bumpy could diminish in amount or , even , be completely .
in their conference a opinion technological of the pretty , dictada in the framework the year international of the chemistry , was to know that the laboratory to their office develops asfaltos which with polímeros for produce a a with characteristics like to the the town , but with a greater resistance mechanics , therefore to high as to in temperatures .
herrera nájera estimó that this kind of asfaltos which could used in places where the climate is extremely becoming , as some cities the north the country , for improve their every and , what therefore , the training of pretty .
he that the bury , the part more disproportionately the oil , is a whole of moléculas of hidrocarburos , of high weight molecular , on asfaltenos , and other of under weight molecular , on maltenos , that institutes you are the pavimento their characteristic behaviour viscoelástico .
the behaviour viscoelástico the bury is in that to high temperatures , close of the 180 degrees , means as a tanks , to 120 degrees degree their viscosidad is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest , while that to temperatures very in , the bury again quebradizo , added .
what previous means that in the streets the resistance the town not is uniform , but that will constitutes during the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature , emergency the specialist in engineering chemistry .
the researchers of the fq observed that the streets of the city of mexico in their majority are covered pavimento flexible , the which consists of six collected of materials , of the which the last three involucran the bury .
between the collected more superficiales is the carpeta asfáltica , conformada small stones bañadas in bury and then compactadas .
every a of the piedritas that is the carpeta , pointed , is bañada with town .
the transitar the vehicles and generarse efforts , this allows that the forces are very well in the pavimento .
if like of town amended difundirían still better , opinion the engineering chemical .
on the carpeta asfáltica , abundó , put a last layer call carpeta of rodadura , the which is benefit of a material of stone fine , is say , a bit that also baña in town .
as is of the as that is to be in contact with the llantas of the vehicles , must have more force mechanics that the carpeta asfáltica and provide fricción in the way .
the be the part the pavimento that is to receive and salvage the efforts , the carpeta of rodadura required , also , have the thick appropriate and must they the material the that is real .
the climate , especially the content and the exchange of temperature , also are a factor very important to be , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the every of the carpeta asfáltica .
when the ground humedece , the water you in the internal of the carpeta and is difficult that it , this level a reblandecimiento of all the ground the pavimento and , what therefore , the training of pretty .
in the process of training of a bache , said , the first in desgastarse is the film of rodamiento and only after affects the carpeta asfáltica , but the damage not happens instantáneamente , but that is a process that should atenderse to the first signals with produce programmes of maintained .
the also member the system national of researchers he that the burden vehicular is another factor important in the training of bumpy and , this , the thick of every a of the drainage the pavimento must go always in relationship with the burden vehicular and ensure that question , for avoid that train pretty influenced .
raphael herrera warned that still there much that grips and work on the bury , example , the emulsiones asfálticas , that in other countries already are even in the market and it reparar the pretty with easily and without need of use high temperatures .
¿ what you targets to the mrs the valley for be the new señorita colombia ?
analysis of the factors that incidieron to that melina ramírez serna not alcanzara the maximum of señorita colombia .
the valley a its title number 14 of who .
of new the valley the cauca is with the to of the maximum of señorita colombia .
this time melina ramírez serna had that shaping with be in the podio of ganadoras , lucir the maximum of silver and the longer that the acreditan as new princess of colombia .
with the result successful anoche in cartagena , where the señorita atlantic alzó with the nickel and the cetro , the department already sum 14 titles of princess and melina a to the legion of women vallecaucanas that have state close of the crown but that were proclamas princesas between them of ospina benoit ( 1947 ) , clear domínguez borrero ( 1949 ) , from bellini ayala ( 1979 ) , was designer ( 1981 ) , rose mary alzate ( 1983 ) , olga maría arenas ( 1987 ) , leila blanque ( 1988 ) , mónica evers ( 1989 ) , maría consuela pinedo ( 1990 ) , diana isabel romero ( 1993 ) , giselle garcés aljure ( 2000 ) , catalina giraldo ( 2007 ) , stephanie garcés aljure ( 2008 ) .
today the great question that many they is ¿ what meet ?
because the result represents the defeat of a great favorita that in every presentation proved that it had all for be the new señorita colombia , not in vain was elected as of the police and better face jolie of vogue , titles that were reinas as taliana vargas or natalia navarro who were the maximum of señorita colombia .
the first factor that as key in the decision that took the jury of designarla first princess as in that not convenció with their answer to the question &quot; ¿ what is that book that you has some to you and what ? real martín murillo gómez , of the carreta literaria leamos .
interrrogante the vallecaucana replied :
&quot; read much , i quite in the literature , i that is a way of culturalizarse , definitely i that the book that i period of childhood is &quot; the principito &quot; , is a book quite their .
currently it &quot; crime and punishment &quot; , is a book of literature universal that all we read ; and today in day i found the book of irene nemirovski , a russian , a book hermosísimo that is &quot; the ardor of the blood &quot; &quot; .
a answer that little was first the term &quot; culturalizarse &quot; and second not explain of way particular of what way every one of the books that citó the have some .
but the by the ceremony melina own your relaxed and happy with the result &quot; the universe is sabio is what that has that to .
and for all the people , favour read a poquito , &quot; the principito &quot; is a great book &quot;
between the hipótesis been says that valley the quemó the favoritismo .
a journalist bogotano insinuó that the be the corporation , the ovacionada and the cresson that was all the prizes hypothetical ( challenge of gastronomía oster , vote the public the better suit notions , and as mother ) , &quot; that kindled the celos of the other has , estresó to the as and that not brilló in the stage &quot; .
and that notó in its first presentation in suit of one in the a the hilton and their two desfiles in the evening of coronación .
although in both lució safe , notó that you missing the force and the momentum that the representatives of magdalena and atlantic showed .
ariel osorio , journalist the programme &quot; as in home &quot; , the channel rcn opinion that the fact of that melina outside abroad princess &quot; fallen that the mayor that more awarding earns during the contest not is as as &quot; .
addition , valley was to last very esquiva with the press , and there equivocó .
other hipótesis is that valley not in to the jury on their interest towards the work social , that is in recent , the essence the contest national of beauty .
something , two days before of the election the jury international lucy doughty own that them buscaban a woman comprometida with the needs social of its pais .
&quot; the surrounding single not enough in a miss colombia , there that look region beyond of what physical and look in their sensitivity social , that before of imply the contest are already involucradas in projects &quot; , he .
also especula that valley pecó their flaws in the derriere and the fibrosis that you notaba in their abdomen , but is marginal therefore precisely the jury the was as the mayor &apos; beauty natural &apos; with the body more healthy , good food and work physical responsible .
the preparador of reinas borg hernán orozco recognised that melina not had the better body , that had best , &quot; but their problem of fibrosis in the abdomen , that the truth for my not was very notoria , you their points in the last day &quot; .
between therefore the journalist up hoyos , of the magazine cromos as that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the speeches quirúrgicas that practicó .
&quot; the cirugías are well , but valley not the that do .
its body never was strong and here the cobraron &quot; .
this prize , that first time over the contest national of the beauty , after the playing in suit of one about a trapping vaticinio that anoche properly , therefore said that this was the contentillo that raymundo you concedía to melina for not i the will of the crown .
reality or not , what true is that melina since today starts a year of reinado , not as sovereign , but as princess , position that offered the possibility of represent to colombia in one of the certámenes international designation the own contest national .
without however , it will to the history as a of the reinas that to despite of their arrollador step cartagena , was esquiva the nickel .
was the work the caleño that us the cadáver of alfonso cano
a lofoscopista the cali happened to the history as the man that this the death of &quot; alfonso cano &quot; .
the work of these officials key .
the last 4 of november a lofoscopista the cti the cali happened to the history as the man that this the identity the maximum head of the farc : &quot; alfonso cano &quot; , to through the cotejo of their fingerprinting digital .
of the seven lofoscopistas that laboran in the seccional the cti , that week tocaba the time of &quot; availability &quot; to eliazar gonzález , a man of port tejada that been 21 years working in the area of research legal .
the to their career , gonzález worked in municipalities the from , where many sometimes had that internarse more of five days in the jungle to to the website in the that were the bodies that be be at .
in the 2000 found to the capital the valley and , then of to the courses necessary , especializó in lofoscopia , that is the study of the fur of fricción , is say , of the palmas of the hands and of the feet .
the week the operational against alias alfonso cano to eliazar warned that on clothes minimum for three days .
something large expected .
the friday in the night went for the cauca in a single since palmira .
was that should identify two bodies and that sospechaba that one of them was the man that respected to the guerrilla more former the world , what that you were that on the card decadactilar of currently was sáenz ( their real name ) .
however , when came with the team of research the website in the that was the cadáver not what needs their aspect physical , therefore was very different the that had seen in the media of communication .
was without barba , clothing as a fresh of the area , without glasses and much more slip .
but clearly not mienten .
into of a lupa galtoniana , ink , a transplantador and a linterna , eliazar comparó the from fingerprints the cadáver with the of the card .
their an not falló : was &quot; alfonso cano &quot; .
that same night , the man oriundo of port tejada was the responsible of confirmarle the minister of defence , john german pinzón , that was the maximum head of the farc .
in search of the left
for a dactiloscopista of the sijín of cali the recognition that was the president john manuel order to eliazar gonzález , in the wheel of press the operational against &quot; cano &quot; , is very significant .
many people not known our work .
the dactiloscopia is a science accurate , for the mistake , that can to to be key in the resolution of crimes .
from of the identification of bodies , the lofoscopistas support research crimes as hurto and murder and there the identity of the people capturadas .
when alone , many criminals have cédulas thinking or not have all .

the receiving proposes choose the president european by universal
the first day the congress of the union cristiano-demócrata ( badge ) , the monday 14 of november , in leipzig , has appropriations without large difficulties for telephoned telephoned , chancellor and president the party cristiano-demócrata .
at not had including in the order the day the future of europe , but the issue particularly in autumn , in particular for satisfy to the fighters that they that the policy the government is currently too little strict with the who and could become in a future with the italian .
the motion on the presidency of the commission european , proposal the direction , adopted virtually unanimously .
the 1.001 parliament , so only registered nine votes in against and ten abstenciones .
the standing ovation of several minutes that ganaron , with their speeches , telephoned withdraw and , after several hours , wolfgang schäuble , the eurófilo minister of finance , despejan any doubt possible .
the idea key of the chancellor , and the the motion , short in a motto : the answer to the crisis &quot; not is less europe , but more europe &quot; .
not only because europe the peace , but also because &quot; nine million of jobs on directly the euro &quot; .
for the chancellor , &quot; has come the time open way in europe &quot; .
this could within in amendments the treaty of lisbon for allow strengthen the control of the union european on the political budgetary of the countries of the area the euro , although also could desembocar in the election the president of the commission european suffrage universal for &quot; i a face to europe &quot; .
in all case , that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted the congress , clearly idea of wolfgang schäuble .
without doubt , is little likely that the into come quickly to a agreement on this change radical : great britain shows hostile to he and the leaders of the receiving seem know that nicolas sarkozy also .
but the court is on the ground .
another hand , the delegates have rejected a majority election the proposal of ponderar the weight of each country of the directive the bank central european in role the weight of each economy , what which obviously reforzaría the weight of germany .
ansiosa calmar the encouraged in the internal of its party , the chancellor has increased the no to konrad adenauer and helmut kohl . but not is that has tried who to their congress to at of the &quot; small &quot; countries european or of the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the he germany .
although the motion on europe he a paragraph to the importance of &quot; the friendship franco-alemana &quot; , telephoned withdraw not has mentado to france .
unless last .
time that , ago two centuries , in a bloody battle in line .
of fact , was a of the derrotas more being for the army of rostopchine .
the impact the fraud in the low disease
after the benefits , the ump and the government emprenden a for against the lower disease .
nicolas his will the tuesday 15 of november in from for visit a box responsible of the benefits family and use a speech on the issue , already recurrent since 2007 , of the fight against the fraud social and the ayudantía .
also , for her as for , that part of the will of save of way thorough , but still so reminds to a which of the campaign presidential of right , the majority to look in the in disease .
in first place , for apply cuts budgetary : the government for impose to the workers the sector private a fourth day of we before of power if the low .
in final , unless that there a convention the company specific , a worker that caiga ill would four days of wage , is say , a minimum the 15 % of their income month .
is of a measure that could on a wave of ira , but that would save 280 million of eur , according they echos .
also , would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic : impose to the officials a day of we remains in case of low labour ( to the time , not have we , with to the three days that apply in the sector private ) .
while debaten these issues , the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud , this time it towards the abuses of the in labour .
&quot; will to incrementarse significantly the controls and , also , if which to someone planned a fraud , must reembolsar the cuantías &quot; , would xavier bertrand about in the rtl the sunday 13 of november .
the as that in the other cases , the effects the announcement seem slightly desproporcionados to the reality the fraud in on of in labour .
of fact , since 2002 of a monitoring constant of this issue and have it various offensive policies that , normally , have given as .
the french not enferman that in the rest of europe .
look with attention , in first the , the figures national .
according the institute french of the security social ( cnam ) , in 2006 abonaron more of 237 million of eur in particular in working .
according the institute french of research and other in economy of the health , the benefits the low representaron , in 2008 , the 5 % the expenditure health , ascendiendo to 11.300 million of eur .
of this sum , the 46 % is to the low leave and accidents labour , while that the 54 % is related with the low disease , figure that out to 6.200 million of eur .
therefore , the 2,5 % the spending in health .
in 2010 , the french have cogido a average of 14,5 days of low labour , with 17,8 in 2009 , according a study the group soul consulting .
a average that , doubt , behind government : other survey , published in 2007 the syrian of management professional monster.com , mostraba that the 75 % of the 40.000 workers french encuestados rushing that not had cogido not a only day of low disease .
another study , in this case of the assurance maladie , that that in 2010 the 37 % of the in disease had a an from to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more extended .
if the compared with our neighbours european , the workers french not are more propensos that in other areas to way in disease .
a long study done in 2010 two researchers the cnrs under that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of lack global the work ( therefore reasons of health as of another kind ) oscilaba , in france , between the 10 % and the 11 % , with to a 20 % and a 28 % in denmark , a 15 % in kingdom uk or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the countries netherlands .
the fraud in the low disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not declared .
the fraud has a the limited .
the forward of the legislation , since 2002 , has caused that the controls of the in disease of more of 45 days are sistemáticos .
in 2008 , of 1,5 million of inspections , the cnam comprobó , in a 13 % of the 285.000 by , that the lowest of short an were &quot; unacceptable or too we &quot; , is say , 37.050 cases .
in the case of the lowest of more of 45 days , further to inspections sistemáticas , was that the 11 % of the cases were &quot; rightly adaptados or injustificados ; a figure that , taking as starting a total of 1,2 million , out to 132.000 .
therefore , region a total of 169.000 cases &quot; injustificados &quot; between several million of workers that cogieron a low disease .
doubt , a figure it in compared , example , with the work in black .
according the member of the ump dominique tian , author of a report on this issue in june , this practice will losses of income tax of between 9.000 and 15.000 million of eur the year , is say , more that the cost total of the benefits in and , without doubt , significantly more that the fraud in this last area .

energy :
the facts must assert more that the and
if there a issue that not can try taking in account considerations the short term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy .
the availability and the cost of the electricity on directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies .
is appropriate that a i election be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear .
the debate only will useful if within the whole of the consequences economic , social and environmental of the options proposals .
the french must reform their opinion in facts objectives , in data conservativism .
now that we 7.000 million of people in the planet , the development demographic some the avoiding of the demand we before of 2050 , to less that prive to a huge part of the population world of a element vital .
the same time , will that means the shortage every time greater of the resources pollution for to have electricity continually , without forget the imperiosa need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate , a issue that has disappeared the debate ecological .
the accident the fukushima not change none of these quite .
that , germany it single in its decision of up to the energy nuclear .
that not is the case not of belgium , that about the their to the need of find a source capable of sustituirla , not of switzerland , that only has aim build central of last generation .
another hand , great britain , finland , poland , republic czech , countries netherlands , sweden , south , china , india and brazil , quote some examples , are on with determination with their projects .
the states united , its on , after fukushima you add a unit to their park , retomando the construction of a central interrumpida after the accident of three mile island .
if the model german , based in the energy renewable , is in times as example , the reality is in against of such speech .
the election of berlin is to mean a encarecimiento the price of the electricity , a greater on energy the need incrementada of gas imported , in particular of russia , a increase of the emissions of co2 for the construction of central of gas and of coal .
in the months , notarán the effects harmful .
be meditarse on the case of denmark .
campeón of europe in the sector eólico , the which this the 30 % of its electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the intermitencia the wind ; this reason , their emissions of co2 and the price of their electricity are , respectively , a 65 % and a 50 % more high that the average european .
the contrary , thank to the information of our policy energy , our neighbours abonan a they of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the who french .
while that in a economy needed the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the maintained of the usefulness industrial in the territory national , the companies french benefit of the electricity more cheap of europe .
that reason , any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear contribute a strong said the price of the electricity , what that restaría realism to the maravillosas statements on the reindustrialización of our country and the defence of our power purchasing .
is of a price that the great majority of the french refuse to pay and , of fact , not manifiestan opposition principle to that kind of energy , according show the out .
us that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with 125.000 jobs of work director and 410.000 jobs indirectos .
this it to the export , ways a galaxy of pymes specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not deslocalizables .
if france decidiese leave the energy nuclear , could the sacrificio of great part of these smes and the loss of the 6.000 million of eur year in exports french of equipment and services nuclear .
¿ what electricista encargaría a epr designed to work sixty years , when is to the collapse of their manufacturer ?
for put the equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity , the as that not there a source diabólica .
the development part of areva of solutions with low emissions of co2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the nature further of the sources of energy .
in the case of the energy nuclear , is essential to the maximum level of security .
in france , we of a authority of security that by a control needs and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of flamanville .
our equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also more the security .
in a century , sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious .
so only one , the of three mile island , in in conditions operational normal ; not was consequences or for the people not for the half environment .
in chernobyl , the accident was the design the sink and to a failures human imperdonables .
in fukushima , some people seem forget that the accident due to two disasters natural of a reach without an , that throughout the death of tens of thousands of people .
the sector nuclear aprenderá of this accident , such as was of the two previous .
thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and arrangements french and germans , the epr is a design capable of resistir to such phenomena .
while what estudian all the players electric that want build a central , the interruption of their construction in flamanville would a great gift for the competitors of areva and edf , since that them commodities way free for taking the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear .
is essential and legitimate to the best options energéticas for our country , but would irresponsible to that the taught , the dogmas and the volume partisanas dominasen a debate so important for the situation economic , social and financial of our country .
immigration , ¿ a burden or a opportunity to the economy ?
the policy of immigration roundly nicolas his has been criticada that since various points of view : the saturación of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the aid of this policy with the statute autoproclamado of &quot; country of the rights human &quot; of france .
more recently , is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has saltado to the headlines , with the prime of internal ( véase the newspaper libération the 23 of may ) proclamando of last that france &quot; not needs talentos foreign , workers not camareros &quot; .
however , rarely time analysing since the point of view economic .
the issue is that , on this issue , there consensus between the left and the right .
in the case of the right , jacques chirac fijó the it declarando in 1976 that &quot; 900.000 unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants &quot; , while that in the left , the tone what fijó michel very explicando that france &quot; not can done office of whole the misery the world &quot; in 1990 .
the only difference , degree of generosity
in 2005 , therefore the left as the right compartían the fear to the invasion the territory national a range of fontaneros poles .
both both , as that the immigrants are a burden to the economy and the society french .
the only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that act with regard the immigrants .
in its programme , mitterrand hollande limited to include banalidades , those that the codesarrollo will right the &quot; problem of the migration &quot; .
this idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is being electoralmente , but economically its very face .
as as guarding the economists ian goldin and geoffrey cameron in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( exceptional people : how migration shaped our world and will tighter our future , may of 2011 , princeton university associated , 352 pp . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants .
the restrict of the immigration it the growth and also the employment .
the fears about with the impact of the immigrants based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national , in particular to the little would , pressing for that reduce their wages .
but the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well commission that do of the workers national and use mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment .
the immigrants little would working in sectors that not big to workers national and the more would in sectors country where the training not by the demand of personal .
a positive on the wages
the same way that a dr would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of anestesistas , the complementariedad between national and immigrants from that the arrival of these last chance welcome in the wages and the employment of the national .
taking in account previous , giovanni peri calculó that a increase the 1 % of the flows migratory is a takes of the wages real to long term of between a 0,6 and a 0,9 % .
and , without have in account the fact of that the diversity that aportan the immigrants towards to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ( there a great proportion of awarding nobel americans naturalizados and companies as google , intel , paypal , ebay and yahoo were degrading immigrants ) .
the immigrants also are taxpayers net to the systems social , since that aportan the average a 1 % the budget total in the countries european .
the organisation international the work estimated , example , that in germany a immigrant that when with a age of 30 years conducted a contribution neta ( income least expenditure ) of 150.000 eur to the budgets public of average for whole their life .
the principle of their mandate , nicolas his wanted go to to the points of growth that you faltaban &quot; with the european &quot; .
these european , that disuadieron to the immigrants , had exactly the effect salem .
europe chance the democracy , only lack think in a democracy european
the democracy is a precious , but also fragile .
the continent european should power acordarse of this already that , although invented in athens ago more of two billion years , to what long the century the has suffered the tragedies of the war world , totalitarismos , the holocaust , the ideas , but also to very in spain , to days in portugal , the coroneles in greece .
some perhaps up that , for that the democracy triunfase definitive on their enemies , would enough as the vote and the way more direct possible .
know , since rostopchine &quot; the small &quot; , that was the something considered .
the suffrage universal , although is of a condition necessary for the democracy , not is enough only and even can become in a &quot; instrument of oppression &quot; , as said home the filósofo republicano etienne vacherot .
not , the democracy required much more : a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , issue , solidarity economic and social , justice .
the crisis that we in europe is a crisis economic , but is to point of a in a crisis policy and democratic .
the palinodia the referendum greek verdadero-falso had , to this regard , a double effect intend : was the need of a return take of the sphere policy , but also the worrying that of their alternatively , of their trying .
be reflexionarse on this an for superarla .
the truth is that the lines the with of the battle democratic currently have desplazado and that , in many cases , the soldiers republican already not progressive in the good sense .
not saldremos if we a succession of referenda national , organised in role of the needs and of way desordenada .
a signing in white the monarca european all or a high the to the hole nacionalista : ¡ what options for the citizen !
not , not want from coups of effect , but a exercise common , of plenary right , relaxed and ongoing , of the options and the democracy , this time to at european .
not there crisis in greece , italy , spain , portugal ( of fact , not sabríamos where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , crisis of europe .
the whole of europe is the that pliega to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , that the that go their of and their lack of solidarity .
is the whole of europe the that suffering a additional in the sphere international .
we into the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but is all europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and , with it , every a of their nations .
what more urgent is that the sovereignty popular s the which the project european .
because only together will the european reduce the weight of their debts , explained of the markets and preparation its future by the investment .
the an of the crisis stop decisions to at european that not will issue without a legitimacy democratic total , unless that be for conducirnos the disaster .
after have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of jacques delors , all the world calls in the today a governance economic european .
that it .
but think in she without a greater integration policy and democratic , and that be vivida as as the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new point died .
we taking a new stage the construction european .
to build the republic in france , was be &quot; to &quot; republicans .
the revolution round interests not be enough .
this lesson is applies .
we build a europe more integrated from the point of view economic .
only will to build a europe more democratic in the level political , a real sovereignty popular european .
to build europe , us european .

the nord stream , new door into the gas russian in europe
the pipeline nord stream , that comunica directly europe western with russia further the fund the sea baltic , already has since in service .
must supply gas to satisfy the needs of thirty million of who .
gazprom , the as russian the gas , has wanted there the event with great pompa .
the last tuesday , more of 500 invited , including four heads of state and of government , were to on the baltic , between the music of the orquesta and a delicate bufet , in the opening the nord stream , the new pipeline that comunica directly , under the sea , russia with germany .
symbolically , the chancellor german angela telephoned , the president russian at indication , the first minister french mitterrand fillon and their counterpart of the countries netherlands , mark rutte , have girado together the volante of the válvula that controls the entry of gas russian in the network of europe western .
with this new pipeline , every year target 27,5 million of metres metres of gas russian additional to europe western to through of a first had of 1.224 km that comunican the region of st petersburg with the land of mecklemburgo-pomerania .
a second tubo should concluirse to end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55.000 million of metres cubic of gas , is say , enough to cover all the consumption french .
addition , already about of the possibility of build a third tubo the same way .
to gazprom , the completion to time of this huge labour is aires of victory .
poland and the countries baltic had are strongly the project .
of fact , the nord stream is to to supply gas directly to germany , any the course earth third countries ( poland and ukraine ) .
of coup , these two countries some something of its power : for them , will more difficult influence in russia amenazándola with cerrarle the access to the markets of europe western .
in the point álgido the debate , warsaw not dudó in for the nord stream as a &quot; new pact germano-soviético &quot; , in reference to the alliance between hitler and stalin to should poland in 1939 .
is that , if the issue is politically delicate .
europe western , support the project russian , has taken a greater security of supply .
but the price is a weakening of the europe of the energy , given that the project has led a gap between the european of this and the west .
russia has known , in so only five years , to triunfar their vision of a alliance direct between russia and the countries western rich , large consumers of gas and with reserves every time more limited .
&quot; this pipeline is a component of our partnership with russia , a new arteria that we unite of way growers &quot; , this mitterrand fillon during the opening the pipeline , proving to what point the large contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic .
all this it the broad greeted in the sides of the forced of gazprom , many in lubmin , in the point of arrival the gas .
the construction of this pipeline also a achievement technical .
the tubo submarino is made of steel recubierto of you for protegerlo against the anclas of the ships .
supports in the fund of sea , to a average of 200 values of depth .
to construirlo , was necessary avoid camps of mines that along of the second war world .
&quot; was necessary with or destroy a centena of them , caution &quot; , jens müller , spokesman of the society nord stream .
also , s necessary best the measures of protection of the way and the flora .
the tubo is a long chinese of metal that rate as 242 torres eiffel and not is cut in whole their length : not válvulas , not stations of peacekeeping .
was measures a platform of control in the waters of sweden , but the responsible the project renunciaron to the same the see that the swedish not were very prepared to allow that a society state russian estableciera of way permanent in the sea with to their as .
&quot; in case of avería , interrumpiremos the step of gas in least of a minute &quot; , there jens müller .
in case flight , the gas the pipeline liberará , therefore , to the atmosphere .
but the arrangements they little likely that would a flight , since that have to junturas that , according the forecasts , will a flight each 100.000 years .
the control the state the pipeline does by a him submarino , arrastrado a per , that of inspections foreign , so as by a has that everything the internal the pipeline .
with the way of a pure , introduces in the internal the tubo , that has a across of a metre , and at with the gas .
to their arrival , after three hours minutes of journey to a at of three metres second , also data precise on possible deformaciones the metal .
the pipeline has been designed for work for fifty years need of no kind of reparación .
the movement the gas an simply the pressure .
the principle is the 200 bars and , to the way of 100 bars .
five companies have uk their forces to power to out this project .
the company leader is gazprom , that has the 51 % of the comes .
to she , unieron the german e.on and basf ( 15,5 % every a ) , so as the netherlands gasunie and the group french gdf suez ( 9 % every one ) .
these five societies have created a company common , call nord stream , to of build and exploiting the pipeline .
has their headquarters in zoug , switzerland , where the taxation is especially favourable .
after , gazprom alquiló to this society , for a term of there years renewable , the entire of the capacities of transport of gas .
&quot; to gazprom working the capacity total , regardless of the amount of gas that really transport &quot; , there jens müller .
the funding of the construction the pipeline has taken just in a 30 % with the contribution of the accionistas and in a 70 % by loans banking .
the cost total of the labour should to 7.400 million of eur for the two tubos .
to gdf suez , for example , the investment has reached the 240 million .
but the accionistas weaker are insurance of that not superarán their investment , since that gazprom here only the risk of the expenditure .
the pipeline emerge the baltic in lubmin , in a at arenosa plantada pinos .
válvulas , with 4,5 metres of level , form the door of way the gas .
there a sensors that miden the pressure , the temperature and the characteristics specific the gas to the arrival , before of that transfer to the gas germans .
since the last tuesday , the terminal receives a million of metres metres of gas russian every time .
total capacity , will three million time and in 2012 , six million .
